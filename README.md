# Arenic

**Command 8 simultaneous 40-person raids through revolutionary hero recording and layering**

Arenic transforms the complexity of MMO raiding into an innovative single-player experience where you build a guild of 320 heroes, master a unique record-and-replay combat system, and orchestrate massive coordinated battles across multiple interconnected arenas.

## What Makes Arenic Special

### Revolutionary Record & Replay System

### Massive Scale Combat
- **8 Unique Arenas**: Each themed around different character classes with specialized bosses
- **320+ Heroes**: Build and manage a full guild across 8 character archetypes
- **Simultaneous Management**: All arenas run independently with persistent timelines
- **Strategic Depth**: Every decision cascades across multiple timelines and battlefields

## Key Features

## How to Play

### Core Controls
| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **WASD** | Move active character (tile-by-tile) |
| **Tab** | Switch between characters in current arena |
| **Q/E** | Navigate between different arenas |
| **R** | Start recording a 2-minute action sequence |
| **F** | Finalize and save recording as a ghost |
| **W** | Toggle between arena and overworld view |
| **1-4** | Activate character abilities |

### Getting Started
1. **Learn the Basics**: Master movement and combat in Arena 1
2. **Record Your First Ghost**: Press R, perform a 2-minute sequence, press F to save
3. **Layer Strategies**: Add more recordings to build coordinated attacks
4. **Expand Operations**: Use Q/E to manage additional arenas
5. **Build Your Guild**: Recruit new heroes through successful combat

### Strategic Depth
- **Timing is Everything**: Synchronize abilities across multiple ghosts for devastating combos
- **Positioning Mastery**: End recordings in safe positions for seamless cycle transitions
