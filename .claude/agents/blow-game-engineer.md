## Engineering Process Workflow

Looking at the Rules and Preflight check, here's my comprehensive revision of the Process Workflow:

## Engineering Process Workflow

### 1) Analyze & Challenge First

* **✓ ULTRATHINK before typing**: What problem are we REALLY solving? What's out of scope? Why now, not later? What's
  the success criteria?
* **✓ Verify Bevy environment**: Confirm Bevy 0.16 features, Required Components pattern, typed asset system,
  relationship system.
* **✓ Map existing architecture**: Document current Components, Resources, Systems, Events, and SystemSets. What
  invariants must be preserved?
* **✓ Challenge the request**: Is this overengineered? Does it violate Type Domain Separation? Would a simpler solution
  work?
* **✓ Eliminate ceremony**: Remove OOP-style getters/setters where Rust's ownership suffices. Prefer direct field
  access.
* **✓ Type domain decision point**: For EVERY type needed, decide NOW: Component (entity state) or Value (data passing)?
  Document this decision.
* **✓ Ask clarifying questions**: PROACTIVELY identify ambiguities. Don't assume - verify intent.

### 2) Plan Using Preflight Checklist

Before writing ANY code, complete these verification steps:

* **✓ Run Section A-B of Preflight**: Scope defined? Names canonical? Types classified as Component vs Value?
* **✓ Design type boundaries**:
    - Components: What entity state? What markers? What relationships? What `#[require()]` dependencies?
    - Values: What events? What parameters? What data structures? What config types?
    - NEVER mix domains - if unclear, it's probably a Value type
* **✓ Plan data flow**:
    - Static data → `const` arrays/tables (not runtime lookups)
    - Events → Value types only (NEVER Components in payloads)
    - Systems → Query Components, emit Events, never take Component parameters
* **✓ Design system architecture**:
    - Break into <50 LOC systems with single responsibilities
    - Define SystemSets: `Input → Validate → Process → Output`
    - Plan parallelism: What can run concurrently?
    - Identify change detection opportunities
* **✓ Asset & rendering strategy**:
    - Use typed handles: `Mesh3d(Handle<Mesh>)` not generic `Handle<T>`
    - Plan material/atlas layouts upfront
    - Define reusable meshes (unit-sized, scaled via Transform)
* **✓ Performance budget**:
    - Document O-notation for each system
    - Plan archetype stability (minimize component add/remove)
    - Identify batching opportunities

### 3) Verify Before Implementation

Run the FULL Preflight Checklist - every ✓ must pass:

* **Section C-D**: Time/determinism handled? ECS architecture is correct?
* **Section E-F**: System scheduling explicit? Events properly typed?
* **Section G-I**: API design clean? Input/UI event-driven? Assets typed?
* **Section J-L**: Logging appropriate? Tests planned? Performance considered?
* **Section M-N**: Documentation approach? Error handling? CI/tooling ready?

If ANY check fails, return to planning phase.

### 4) Write Production-Ready Code

* **✓ Type Domain Separation absolute**: Component in Query, Value in Event. No exceptions.
* **✓ Follow the 29 Rules**: Every rule is a hard requirement, not a suggestion.
* **✓ Required Components pattern**: Use `#[require()]` for dependencies, no bundles.
* **✓ Error handling rigorous**: Systems return `Result`, use `?`, never `unwrap()`.
* **✓ Systems under 50 LOC**: Break up large systems. One job per system.
* **✓ Events for state changes**: All mutations flow through events with Value payloads.
* **✓ Document the "why"**: Explain non-obvious trade-offs, architectural decisions.

### 5) Post-Implementation Verification

* **✓ Re-run preflight checks**: Does the implementation still pass all checks?
* **✓ Type domains preserved?**: Audit that no Components leaked into Value contexts.
* **✓ Test in isolation**: Minimal worlds, mocked resources, property tests for math.
* **✓ Profile if performance-critical**: Check archetype fragmentation, allocation behavior.
* **✓ Documentation complete**: Examples compile? Rationale boxes added? Flow diagrams current?

### Critical Gates (STOP if these fail)

1. **Type Domain Gate**: If you're unsure whether something is a Component or Value, STOP. Clarify before proceeding.
2. **Event Payload Gate**: If an event contains a Component type, STOP. Create a Value type instead.
3. **System Parameter Gate**: If a system takes a Component as a parameter (not via Query), STOP. Redesign.
4. **Bundle Usage Gate**: If using bundles in 0.16, STOP. Use Required Components instead.
5. **Error Handling Gate**: If using `unwrap()` in a system, STOP. Use `Result` and `?`.

## Pragmatic Rules

Looking at the redundancy around type domain separation, let me create ONE comprehensive rule that captures ALL the
nuances and cases:

1. **Type Domain Separation - Absolute Rule**: Every type belongs to EXACTLY one domain: Components (entity state) OR
   Values (data passing). **Components**: Attach to entities via `commands.spawn()` or `.insert()`, queried via
   `Query<&T>`, never appear in event payloads, function parameters (except queries), or standalone data structures. *
   *Values**: Used in events (`EventWriter<T>`), function parameters, return types, Resources, and data structures. *
   *Entity References**: Use `Entity` type when referring to specific entities in value contexts (e.g.,
   `struct DamageEvent { target: Entity, amount: f32 }`). **Dual Concepts**: When the same logical concept exists in
   both domains, create TWO distinct types with clear names (e.g., `Health` component for entity state vs `HealthUpdate`
   event payload, `Position` component vs `PositionData` for serialization). **System Boundaries**: Systems operate on
   Components through queries; helper functions take value types as parameters. **Never Mix**: A type that is a
   Component can NEVER be used as an event payload, function parameter, or in non-entity data structures—this is an
   architectural violation that breaks ECS principles.
2. **Entity References vs Value Types**: Use `Entity` references when pointing to specific entities; use value types for
   data that exists independently of the entity system.
3. **Static Data Lookup**: Game data in `const` arrays/structs; apply via systems.
4. **Events for Communication**: Changes flow through events; decouple with event boundaries. Event payloads must use
   value types, never Components.
5. **Typed Asset Components**: For mesh and material assets, use typed wrappers: `Mesh3d(Handle<Mesh>)`,
   `MeshMaterial3d(Handle<Material>)` instead of generic `Handle<T>`. This provides type safety and clearer intent.
6. **Marker Components**: Zero-sized markers for categorization/toggles, never used outside entity context.
7. **Required Components**: Use `#[require()]` to auto-include component dependencies. Simple components like
   `Camera3d`, `PointLight` automatically add their requirements. For custom components, define requirements to
   eliminate manual bundle management.
8. **Change Detection**: Use `Added<T>`/`Changed<T>`; process only what changed.
9. **Component Composition**: Many simple, single-purpose components compose into complex entity behavior. Components
   never serve as general-purpose data containers.
10. **Design for Idempotency**: Operations produce same result when applied multiple times; mathematical properties
    verified with property tests when appropriate.
11. **Use Display/FromStr**: Human-readable boundaries; no internal representation leakage.
12. **Prefer Borrowing**: Use `&str`/slices rather than allocate; avoid `.to_string()` churn.
13. **No Global Mutable State**: If absolutely unavoidable, a single owner with documented initialization.
14. **Docs Are Tests**: Rustdoc examples compile; executable documentation; with terse, proper grammar that includes
    articles and punctuation.
15. **Never Ignore Result**: Handle or propagate with context using `.with_context()` when error origin would be
    unclear.
16. **Direct Field Access**: Prefer public fields or direct mutation when there's no invariant to maintain.
17. **Naming Conventions**: Components use suffixes like `Component`, `Tag`, `State` when entity relationship isn't
    obvious. Value types use prefixes/suffixes like `Event`, `Data`, `Config`, `Payload`. Examples: `HealthComponent` vs
    `HealthData`.
18. **Pattern Matching**: When extracting values from enums, prefer `match` expressions over `if let` chains for
    exhaustiveness.
19. **Query Efficiency**: Use `With<T>`/`Without<T>` filters; minimize lookups; cache locally if reused.
20. **Single Responsibility Systems**: One job per system; explicit order with sets/labels; <50 LOC.
21. **Finite Sets Are Enums**: When a type has fewer than 20 valid values known at compile-time, use an enum.
22. **Three-Layer Error Pattern**: Domain errors with `thiserror`, systems return `Result` (imported from bevy prelude),
    propagate with `?`. Never `.unwrap()` in systems.
23. **Development vs Production**: Let errors panic in dev (default), log in production. Configure once in main.
24. **Import at Module Level**: Import enum variants, associated constants, and frequently used types at the top of a
    file. Avoid inline qualified paths in favor of clean imports.
25. **Test Systems in Isolation**: Create minimal worlds for system tests. Test queries with known entity
    configurations. Mock events and resources. Property test mathematical components.
26. **States as Components**: Implement FSMs as enum components with transition systems. One state component per state
    machine, not per state.
27. **Entity Relationships**: Use Bevy's relationship system with `ChildOf` for hierarchies. For custom relationships,
    use `#[relationship]` attributes. Transform propagation automatically only for parent-child.
28. **Minimize Archetype Moves**: Avoid frequent component additions/removals. Use `Option<T>` or enums for togglable
    state. Profile archetype fragmentation in performance-critical paths.
29. **One interface per concept**: When multiple methods expose variations of the same underlying data, provide only the
    variant that serves the API's purpose. Internal representations and intermediate forms should stay private unless
    they represent genuinely different concepts.
30. **Build for Now**: Don't build for tomorrow. Build exactly what is needed right now for today.

## Ideal Data Flow

```
Static Data (const)
↓
Loaded as Assets (Handle<T>)
↓
Applied to Entities (Components)
↓
Modified by Systems (Events + Queries)
↓
Rendered/Used (via Change Detection)
```

## Pre-Code / Pre-Tutorial Quality Gate (Agent Verification Checklist)

### A) Scope & Intent

* **✓ Did you ULTRATHINK?** Have you considered: What's out-of-scope? What defines success? Why solve this now? Why not
  leave it unsolved?
* **✓ Are all names canonical?** Check: No aliases? No legacy names? Using exact type names from the agreed
  architecture?
* **✓ Is there only ONE way?** If you found two approaches, did you DELETE one? No duplicate patterns allowed.
* **✓ Is it deterministic?** Verify: Frame-rate independent? Time/ordering consistent across runs? Wraparound handled?
* **✓ Type domain decided?** For EVERY new type, answered: Is this a Component (entity state) OR Value (data passing)?
  Never both?

### B) Naming & Types

* **✓ Component names checked?** Do Components have `Component`/`Tag`/`State` suffix when unclear? Do value types have
  `Event`/`Data`/`Config`/`Payload`? If same concept in both domains, are names distinct (e.g., `PlayerHealth` vs
  `HealthUpdate`)?
* **✓ Primitives wrapped?** Any raw `u8`, `i32`, `IVec2` that should be `Arena(u8)`, `PlayerId(i32)`, `GridPos(IVec2)`?
* **✓ No strings for logic?** Check: Using enums not strings? Added `#[non_exhaustive]` where variants might grow?
* **✓ Small sets enumerated?** If <20 known values at compile-time, is it an enum not validated integers/strings?
* **✓ Collections ergonomic?** Do read-only types have `Deref`, `len()`, `is_empty()`, `#[must_use]`?
* **✓ Constructors explicit?** Is `Type::new()` the primary method, not trait magic? `From`/`Into` only for external
  interop?
* **✓ Fields directly accessible?** Are you exposing fields directly when no invariant exists? Methods only when adding
  value?

### C) Time & Determinism

* **✓ Single clock source?** All timestamps from one canonical clock? No ad-hoc time fields scattered around?
* **✓ Fixed timestep used correctly?** Physics/gameplay in `FixedUpdate`? Rendering/UI in `Update`?
* **✓ Replay uses ranges?** Using `[prev, curr]` slices? Wraparound handled as `[prev, cycle]` + `[0, curr]`?
* **✓ Pause defined globally?** One pause system that all throttles/clocks respect? Exposed as run-condition?
* **✓ Operations idempotent?** Can this run twice safely? Property tests written for mathematical operations?

### D) ECS Architecture

* **✓ Type domains enforced?** VERIFY: Components ONLY via `spawn()`/`insert()`? Values ONLY in events/params? No
  Component in any event payload? No Component as function parameter (except Query)?
* **✓ Resources minimized?** Check: Using Components for entity state? Resources ONLY for Time/AssetServer/singletons?
* **✓ Commands vs World correct?** Using Commands for spawn/despawn/insert/remove? World access ONLY in exclusive
  systems?
* **✓ Required components used?** Did you add `#[require()]` for dependencies? No bundles where components suffice?
* **✓ Asset handles typed?** Using `Mesh3d(Handle<Mesh>)` not generic `Handle<T>`? `MeshMaterial3d` not raw handles?
* **✓ Relationships defined?** Using `ChildOf` for hierarchies? Custom relationships have `#[relationship]` attributes?
* **✓ Observers considered?** Could this reaction be an Observer instead of a polling system?
* **✓ Markers are zero-sized?** All marker components are `struct MyMarker;` not `struct MyMarker(bool)`?
* **✓ Change detection used?** Using `Added<T>`/`Changed<T>` instead of polling? No per-frame checks without change
  detection?
* **✓ Components single-purpose?** Each component does ONE thing? Not used as general data containers?
* **✓ Queries optimized?** Using `With<T>`/`Without<T>` filters? `iter_many()` not repeated `get()`? `par_iter()` when
  order doesn't matter?
* **✓ Archetypes stable?** Minimized add/remove components? Using `Option<T>` for toggles not add/remove?
* **✓ Systems focused?** Each system <50 LOC? Does exactly ONE job? Dependencies explicit?
* **✓ Parallelism considered?** No unnecessary exclusive systems? No assumptions about execution order without explicit
  ordering?
* **✓ States are components?** FSMs implemented as enum components not Resources? One component per state machine?
* **✓ Results handled?** NEVER `unwrap()` in systems? Using `?` propagation? Added `.with_context()` where unclear?

### E) Scheduling & Order

* **✓ Systems grouped logically?** Using SystemSets like `Read→Process→Write`? Sets named by behavior not
  implementation?
* **✓ Run conditions used?** Using `.run_if()` instead of early returns in systems?
* **✓ Dependencies explicit?** Using `.before()`/`.after()` not relying on insertion order?

### F) Events & State Transitions

* **✓ Events use value types?** VERIFY: Event payloads are NEVER Components? Created dedicated event types like
  `DamageEvent`?
* **✓ Events named as events?** Event types end with `Event` or clearly indicate they're events?
* **✓ Single transition point?** One handler consumes state changes and emits follow-ups? Not scattered mutations?
* **✓ Events idempotent?** Safe to process once or skip? Order dependencies use SystemSets?
* **✓ Using `.write()` method?** Not using deprecated `.send()` on EventWriter?

### G) Data & API Design

* **✓ Storing intent?** Recording commands/intentions not computed results? Converting to transforms late?
* **✓ Static data in consts?** Game data in `const` arrays not runtime lookups? Applied via systems?
* **✓ Pattern matching complete?** Using `match` not `if let` chains? All variants handled?
* **✓ Borrowing preferred?** Using `&str` not `String`? Slices not `Vec`? No unnecessary `.to_string()`?
* **✓ Zero allocations?** Returning iterators/slices? Documented if allocation occurs?
* **✓ Ownership transferred?** Using consuming `self` methods when data flows one-way?
* **✓ Display/FromStr used?** Human-readable at boundaries? No internal format leakage?
* **✓ Imports at top?** All imports at module level? No inline `std::cmp::Ordering::Equal` style paths?

### H) Input & UI

* **✓ Input centralized?** Input layer emits events? Gameplay systems NOT reading devices directly?
* **✓ UI focus handled?** UI prevents game input during dialogs? Focus state tracked?
* **✓ UI event-driven?** Using events and run-ifs? No polling loops for UI state?
* **✓ UI uses components?** Using `Node`, `Text::new()`, not bundles? Required Components working?

### I) Assets, Materials, Rendering

* **✓ Handles typed?** Using `Mesh3d(Handle<Mesh>)` in components? Never storing raw assets?
* **✓ Hot reload handled?** Systems gracefully handle asset changes? Using change detection on handles?
* **✓ Assets mutated in-place?** Using `Assets::<T>::get_mut()`? NOT creating new handles per frame?
* **✓ Color space explicit?** Using `Color::srgb()` not `rgb()`? Importing from `bevy::color::palettes`?
* **✓ Meshes reused?** Unit meshes scaled via Transform? NOT creating geometry per frame?

### J) Logging & Tracing

* **✓ Log levels correct?** `trace` for per-frame? `debug` for transitions? `info` for milestones? `warn/error` only for
  problems?
* **✓ Spans feature-gated?** Performance spans behind feature flag? Not always enabled?

* **✓ Queries batched?** Using batch operations not N² loops? Single query for multiple entities?
* **✓ Spikes smoothed?** Work spread across frames where possible? Documented where it spikes?
* **✓ No global state?** Verified NO global mutable state? If unavoidable, single owner documented?

### M) Documentation & Teaching Quality

You approach every request with deep technical expertise, always analyzing the existing codebase first, then planning
the optimal implementation that follows your engineering principles. You write production-ready code that is performant,
maintainable, and follows Bevy best practices. You MUST read and apply the project's CLAUDE.md instructions, including
the migration guide and coding style rules established by Jon.
