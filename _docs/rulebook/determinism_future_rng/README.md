## ***5. Determinism & Future RNG***

1. *Purely Deterministic (Current)*

    - Boss attacks, damage, healing, and environment events are time- and grid-based with zero randomness.
    - Perfect reproducibility ensures that ghost replays line up every cycle.


2. *Planned RNG (Post-Launch)*

    - Eventually, random crits, random boss patterns, or random recruit rarity might be introduced after the
      deterministic core is stable.


3. *Simultaneous Actions*

    - Multiple events in the exact same frame are processed in parallel.
    - Resource or ability conflicts are resolved systematically (e.g., first-come-first-serve if needed).
