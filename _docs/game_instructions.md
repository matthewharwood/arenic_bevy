# ARENIC: Complete Game Instructions

## Game Overview

**Arenic** is an innovative tactical strategy game where you command up to 320 heroes across 8 simultaneous 40-person raids. Master the revolutionary **Record & Replay** system to build layered ghost recordings, coordinate complex strategies, and conquer challenging boss encounters. Every action matters in this deterministic world where victory comes through precise timing, strategic positioning, and masterful orchestration of your guild's abilities.

## Core Game Concept

### The Innovation: Record & Replay System
The heart of Arenic is its unique recording mechanism:
- **Record** individual hero actions and movements in 2-minute cycles
- **Replay** those recordings as "ghost" characters that automatically repeat their actions
- **Layer** up to 40 ghost recordings per arena to build massive coordinated raids
- **Master** complex strategies by synchronizing multiple heroes across different timelines

### The Goal
Build a guild powerful enough to simultaneously manage 8 different arenas, each with its own boss and unique challenges. Progress through increasingly difficult tiers (Normal → Heroic → Mythic) while growing your roster through strategic gacha recruitment.

## Getting Started

### Your First Steps

2. **Movement**: Use WASD keys to move your hero one tile at a time on the grid
3. **Character Selection**: Press Tab to switch between available heroes in your current arena
4. **Basic Combat**: Your hero will automatically attack nearby enemies based on their abilities

### Understanding the Interface

## The Record & Replay System (Core Mechanic)

### Recording Process
1. **Initiate Recording**: Press R while controlling a character
2. **3-Second Countdown**: Brief preparation period before recording starts
3. **2-Minute Window**: Record all movements and ability usage
4. **Finalize**: Press F to lock in the recording as a permanent "ghost"
5. **Reset Option**: Cancel recording to discard and try again

### Ghost Behavior
- **Automatic Replay**: Ghosts repeat their recorded actions every 2-minute cycle
- **Persistent Activity**: Ghosts continue operating even when you're managing other arenas
- **Perfect Reproduction**: Every movement, ability cast, and timing is exactly reproduced
- **Death Persistence**: If a ghost dies at 1:30 in recording, it will die at 1:30 in every replay

### Strategic Recording Tips
- **Plan Full Sequences**: Think through the entire 2-minute strategy before recording
- **Coordinate Timing**: Align multiple ghosts' actions for maximum effectiveness
- **Leave Buffer Time**: End recordings with safe positioning for the next cycle
- **Test Interactions**: Ensure ghost abilities complement rather than interfere with each other
