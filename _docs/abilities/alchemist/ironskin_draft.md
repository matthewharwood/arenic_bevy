# Ironskin Draft

A complete implementation guide for the Alchemist's defensive potion ability.

## Overview

The **Ironskin Draft** is a self-protection ability that temporarily hardens the Alchemist's skin through alchemical transformation. This defensive potion creates a damage reduction shield that allows the Alchemist to survive heavy enemy assault phases while maintaining their support role. The ability emphasizes timing and positioning, as the protective window must be activated before incoming damage.

## Game Design Philosophy

This ability demonstrates core defensive design principles rooted in predictability and player agency:

**Proactive Defense Over Reactive**: Players must anticipate damage rather than react to it, rewarding game knowledge and enemy pattern recognition. The instant cast ensures players can act on their predictions without execution barriers.

**Resource-Free Accessibility**: No mana or resource costs ensure the ability remains available when needed most, preventing frustrating moments where players know what to do but lack the means.

**Clear Visual Communication**: The Alchemist's skin takes on a metallic sheen during the effect, providing immediate feedback to both the player and teammates about the protective state.

## Implementation Architecture

### Component-Based Design

```rust
IronskinDraft {
    damage_reduction: 0.4,      // 40% damage reduction
    duration: 8.0,              // 8 second protection window
    cooldown: 12.0,             // 12 second cooldown
    cast_time: 0.0,             // Instant activation
}

DefensiveAura {
    visual_effect: "metallic_skin",
    particle_system: "golden_shimmer",
    duration_remaining: f32,
}
```

### Event-Driven Systems

The ability uses four core systems:
1. **Draft Activation** - Handles input detection and instant casting
2. **Damage Reduction** - Modifies incoming damage calculations  
3. **Visual Effects** - Manages the metallic skin transformation
4. **Cooldown Management** - Prevents ability spam and tracks availability

## Step-by-Step Gameplay

### Phase 1: Anticipation (Player Decision)
- **Situation Recognition**: Player identifies incoming damage wave
- **Timing Decision**: Activate before damage hits for maximum effectiveness
- **Positioning**: Maintain support role while protected
- **Team Coordination**: Use protection window to provide healing/buffs

### Phase 2: Activation (Instant Cast)
- **Input**: Single tap triggers immediate effect
- **Visual Feedback**: Skin transforms to metallic appearance with golden shimmer
- **Audio Cue**: Crystalline chime sound indicates successful activation
- **Status Display**: Defense buff icon appears in UI

### Phase 3: Protection Window (8 Second Duration)
- **Damage Reduction**: All incoming damage reduced by 40%
- **Continued Mobility**: Full movement and ability usage maintained
- **Visual Persistence**: Metallic skin effect remains throughout duration
- **Strategic Value**: Allows aggressive positioning for team support

### Phase 4: Recovery (4 Second Vulnerability)
- **Cooldown Period**: 12 second total cooldown (4 seconds after effect ends)
- **Visual Fade**: Metallic effect gradually diminishes
- **Tactical Positioning**: Return to safer positions during vulnerability window
- **Cooldown Tracking**: UI indicator shows time remaining until next use

## Upgrade Paths

### Tier 1: Extended Protection
