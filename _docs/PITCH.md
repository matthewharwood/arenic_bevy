• Top-down view of 9 arenas in a 3x3 grid - imagine a tic-tac-toe board where each square contains its own battlefield

• Each arena is a 40-man raid themed around a classic fantasy archetype:

- Labyrinth: Hunter (traps and precision)
- Guild House: Alchemist (potions and transformation)
- Sanctum: Cardinal (holy magic and healing)
- Mountain: Forager (nature and harvest)
- Bastion: Warrior (tanks and defense)
- Pawnshop: Thief (stealth and treasure)
- Crucible: Also Alchemist themed
- Casino: Merchant (wealth and gambling)
- Gala: Bard (dance and rhythm)

• You record each of the 40 characters one by one, like adding instruments to an orchestra

• That's 9 simultaneous 40-man raids (360 heroes total possible)

• Record one hero's actions for 2 minutes, then it replays as a 'ghost' forever on a loop

• Like making music loops - record one part, then layer another on top while the first keeps playing

• Each arena has its own 2-minute timer - like 9 different songs playing at once

• There's a gacha system for recruiting new heroes and upgrading them

• You keep building up these characters, moving them between arenas until your choreography and characters are strong
enough to win all
