# Ability Sound Prompts (ElevenLabs)

Short, model-ready prompts tailored via our sound design research: high clarity, low masking, non-musical UI
readability. Keep tails tight, avoid low-end build-up, and prevent cognitive overload.

## Alchemist

- Acid Flask: "Glass flask arc with faint whistle, impact glass shatter into caustic fizzing puddle. Bright mid detail (
  2–4 kHz), HPF 200 Hz, short decay 250 ms, no pad or drone, no distortion."

  8–12 kHz), no melody, no reverb wash, conveys brief protective hardening."
- Siphon: "Gentle life-drain whoosh with soft, hollow pull; low-mid breathy draw then fade, HPF 180 Hz, smooth
  non-harsh, 400–600 ms, no musical tone, no hiss bed."

  bass, no reverb bed."
- Trap: "Arming: crisp mechanical click + faint tension whir (120 ms). Detonation: compact dry pop-crack with brief
  debris, 200 ms, no boom."
- Sniper: "Ultra-tight high-velocity crack with faint air snap, 90–120 ms, HPF 200 Hz, no tail, surgical precision."

## Merchant

- Dice: "Short dice rattle with 2–3 clean clacks, 250 ms, bright transients, no low-end, no background bed."

## 40‑Cast Variants (Mass Events)

For simultaneous team casts, use these modifiers on the single‑cast prompts:

- “40 layered one‑shots, onset jitter 10–40 ms, pitch variance ±2–4 semitones, wide stereo distribution, HPF consistent,
  subtle short room 0.2–0.3 s at 8–12% wet for cohesion, avoid masking and low‑end buildup, preserve transient clarity.”
