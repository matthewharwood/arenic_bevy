## ***7. Boss Battles & Mechanics***

1. *2-Minute Boss Timeline*

    - Bosses also operate on a *2-minute* cycle.
    - They have a rotation of attacks (often 30sâ€“2min in pattern length) that's fully deterministic.


2. *Mechanics & Telegraphs* (Design Document)

    - Bosses and the arena can have shifting terrain, traps, or hazards telegraphed on the grid.
    - Large telegraphs or "winds-ups" for big attacks so players can record dodges or counters.
    - Environmental hazards (lava tiles, elemental storms, etc.) also appear with pre-warnings or hazard timers.


3. *No Boss Enrage*

    - There is no forced "enrage timer" at 2:00. The boss simply resets each cycle.


4. *Pattern Recognition*

    - Anticipating the boss's repeated patterns is key to success.
    - Audio/visual cues often precede major attacks.
