## Key Metrics Framework

### Primary Metrics (Must Track)

**Time-to-Green**
- Definition: First successful compilation/run
- Target: <30 minutes for tutorials
- Measurement: Timestamp from start to success

**Drop-off Points**
- Definition: Where users abandon
- Target: <10% per checkpoint
- Measurement: Last completed step

**Error Frequency**
- Definition: Compilation/runtime errors
- Target: <3 per tutorial
- Measurement: Error event counting

### Secondary Metrics

**Reread Patterns**
- Scroll-backs to previous sections
- Indicates confusion/missing info
- Target: <2 per concept

**Copy-Paste Accuracy**
- Successful first-attempt pastes
- Indicates code block quality
- Target: >95% success

**Help-Seeking**
- Documentation searches
- Discord/forum questions
- Target: <20% of users

## Testing Protocols

### Hallway Testing (Quick)
```
Participants: 3-5 developers
Duration: 30-45 minutes
Method: Think-aloud

Tasks:
1. Complete Tutorial 03
2. Note stumbling points
3. Record time-to-green
4. Document questions asked

Analysis:
- Heat map confusion points
- Common error patterns
- Missing prerequisites
```

### Cognitive Task Analysis
```
Participants: 2-3 expert developers
Duration: 60-90 minutes
Method: Retrospective protocol

Process:
1. Expert completes task
2. Replay with narration
3. Identify decision points
4. Map knowledge requirements
5. Compare to junior needs
```

### Diary Studies
```
Participants: 10-15 developers
Duration: 1-2 weeks
Method: Self-reporting

Daily prompts:
- What did you try today?
- Where did you struggle?
- What helped you succeed?
- What's still confusing?
```

## Instrumentation Strategy

### Code-Level Metrics
```rust
// Tutorial checkpoint tracking
pub fn checkpoint(name: &str) {
    #[cfg(feature = "analytics")]
    analytics::event("tutorial_checkpoint", json!({
        "checkpoint": name,
        "timestamp": Instant::now(),
        "attempt": attempt_count(),
    }));
}
```

### Documentation Metrics
```javascript
// Scroll depth tracking
let maxScroll = 0;
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
    const scrollPct = (window.scrollY / document.height) * 100;
    maxScroll = Math.max(maxScroll, scrollPct);
});
```

### Error Tracking
```rust
// Compilation error categorization
match error_type {
    ErrorType::Syntax => record_metric("error.syntax"),
    ErrorType::Type => record_metric("error.type"),
    ErrorType::Borrow => record_metric("error.borrow"),
    ErrorType::Logic => record_metric("error.logic"),
}
```
