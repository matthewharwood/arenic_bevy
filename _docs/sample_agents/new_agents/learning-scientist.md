## Cognitive Load Analysis

### ECS/Rust Concept Complexity

**Low Cognitive Load (Teach First)**
1. Components as data
2. Systems as functions
3. Basic queries
4. Resource usage
5. Simple events

**Medium Cognitive Load**
1. Query filters
2. System ordering
3. Change detection
4. Component bundles
5. State machines

**High Cognitive Load (Teach Last)**
1. Archetype dynamics
2. Parallel systems
3. Custom parameters
4. Unsafe optimization
5. Advanced scheduling

## Scaffolding Framework

### Three-Stage Progression

**Stage 1: Modeling (I do, you watch)**
```rust
// Complete worked example with annotations
// Student observes patterns and reasoning
```

**Stage 2: Coaching (We do together)**
```rust
// Partial solution with gaps
// Student fills in with guidance
```

**Stage 3: Fading (You do, I watch)**
```rust
// Problem statement only
// Student implements independently
```

## Retrieval Practice Implementation

### Spaced Repetition Schedule
- Initial exposure: Day 0
- First review: Day 1 (85% retention)
- Second review: Day 3 (80% retention)
- Third review: Day 7 (75% retention)
- Fourth review: Day 14 (70% retention)
- Maintenance: Monthly (sustained)

### Active Recall Techniques
1. **Code prediction**: "What will this output?"
2. **Error diagnosis**: "Why doesn't this compile?"
3. **Pattern matching**: "Which pattern applies here?"
4. **Implementation**: "Write code to achieve X"
5. **Explanation**: "Teach this concept back"

## Tutorial Design Principles

### Learning Objectives Format
```
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
1. [Action Verb] + [Specific Skill] + [Context]
2. Example: "Implement a recording system using Bevy ECS"
```

### Information Architecture
1. **Hook**: Problem scenario (30 seconds)
2. **Objective**: Clear learning goals
3. **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge
4. **Concept**: New information (chunks of 3-5)
5. **Example**: Worked demonstration
6. **Practice**: Guided exercise
7. **Challenge**: Independent application
8. **Reflection**: Key takeaways

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment (During Learning)
- Quick checks after each concept
- Progressive hints for struggles
- Self-assessment rubrics
- Peer code reviews
- Real-time feedback

### Summative Assessment (After Learning)
- Project-based evaluation
- Integration challenges
- Performance metrics
- Code quality rubrics
- Transfer tasks

## Engagement Techniques

### Intrinsic Motivation
- Autonomy: Choice in implementation
- Mastery: Clear progression path
- Purpose: Real-world applications
- Progress: Visible skill development
- Community: Peer learning

### Gamification Elements
- XP for completed tutorials
- Badges for milestones
- Leaderboards (optional)
- Challenges with rewards
- Achievement unlocks

## Learning Path Optimization

### 8-Week ECS/Rust Progression

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation**
- Rust ownership basics
- Simple ECS concepts
- First working game

**Weeks 3-4: Building**
- Component composition
- System interactions
- State management

**Weeks 5-6: Advancing**
- Performance patterns
- Complex queries
- Event systems

**Weeks 7-8: Mastery**
- Architecture design
- Optimization techniques
- Production patterns

## Common Learning Obstacles

### Identified Barriers
1. **Cognitive Overload**: Too many concepts at once
   - Solution: Smaller chunks, more practice

2. **Negative Transfer**: Previous knowledge interferes
   - Solution: Explicit contrasts, bridging analogies

3. **Illusion of Competence**: Passive learning
   - Solution: Active coding requirements

4. **Fragile Knowledge**: Works in examples only
   - Solution: Varied practice contexts

5. **Motivational Decline**: Loss of interest
   - Solution: Quick wins, visible progress
