## Error Message Framework (CLEAR)

### C - Context
Explain what happened
```

✅ "Recording failed to save"
```

### L - Location
Where the issue happened
```
❌ "Invalid input"
✅ "Timeline position at 125s exceeds 120s limit"
```

### E - Explanation
Why it happened
```
❌ "Operation failed"
✅ "Ghost limit of 320 reached"
```

✅ "Remove unused ghosts or increase limit in Settings"
```

### R - Reassurance
What's safe/saved
```
✅ "Your current recording is safe and can be resumed"
```

## Message Matrix for Recording/Playback

### State × Event Messages

| State | Event | Message |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Idle | Start Recording | "Press R to begin recording (5-second countdown)" |
| Countdown | Counting | "Recording in {n}..." |
| Recording | Update | "Recording... {time}s / 120s" |
| Recording | Warning | "10 seconds remaining" |
| Recording | Stop | "Recording saved! Press C to commit" |
| Playback | Start | "Replaying {ghost_count} ghosts" |
| Playback | Wrap | "Timeline wrapping to 0:00" |
| Error | Overflow | "Max ghosts reached (320). Remove some to continue" |
| Error | Memory | "Low memory - quality reduced automatically" |

## UI Text Patterns

### Button Labels
```
Primary Actions:
✅ "Start Recording" (verb + noun)
✅ "Save Changes"
✅ "Delete Ghost"

❌ "OK" (vague)
❌ "Submit" (generic)
❌ "Yes" (no context)
```

### Empty States
```
No Ghosts Yet
────────────
Record your first run to see
ghost replays here.

[Start Recording]

Tip: Press R anytime to begin
```

### Loading States
```
Progressive disclosure:
0-2s: "Loading..."
2-5s: "Loading ghosts..."
5s+: "Almost there - loading {n} ghosts..."
```

## Accessibility Patterns

### Screen Reader Text
```html
<!-- Visual: "👻 5" -->
<span aria-label="5 ghosts active">👻 5</span>

<!-- Visual: "REC ●" -->
<span aria-label="Recording in progress">REC ●</span>
```

### Plain Language Rules
- Grade 8 reading level
- No jargon without explanation
- Active voice only
- Specific over general
- Concrete over abstract

## Voice Guidelines

### Personality Attributes
- **Helpful**: Guide without patronizing
- **Clear**: Direct without being blunt
- **Encouraging**: Supportive without cheerleading
- **Professional**: Competent without stiffness
- **Human**: Warm without being casual

### Tone Variations

**During Success**
"Perfect! Your recording captured all abilities."

**During Errors**
"That didn't work, but here's how to fix it:"

**During Learning**
"Try using ability 2 near enemies for maximum effect"

**During Waiting**
"Analyzing ghost patterns... finding optimal path..."

## Localization Preparation

### String Structure
```json
{
  "recording.start": "Start Recording",
  "recording.start.tooltip": "Begin a new 120-second recording (R)",
  "recording.countdown": "Recording in {seconds, plural, one {# second} other {# seconds}}",
  "recording.active": "Recording {current}/{total} seconds"
}
```

### Expansion Allowance
- English → German: +35%
- English → French: +20%
- English → Spanish: +25%
- English → Japanese: -10%

Design UI with 40% text expansion buffer.

## Testing Methods

### A/B Testing Framework
```
Variant A: "Ghost limit reached"
Variant B: "You've reached the maximum of 320 ghosts"

Metrics:
- Task completion rate
- Error recovery time
- User satisfaction
- Support tickets
```

### Comprehension Testing
1. Show message for 5 seconds
2. Hide message
3. Ask: "What should you do next?"
4. Measure accuracy

Target: 90% correct action identification

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These
- **Developer speak**: "Null pointer exception"
- **Passive voice**: "The file couldn't be opened"
- **Negative framing**: "You can't do that"
- **Walls of text**: Paragraphs in error messages
- **ALL CAPS**: SHOUTING AT USERS
- **Tech humor**: "Oops, gremlins!" 
- **Blame**: "You entered invalid data"
