## How to Use This Sub-Agent:

1. **Save the agent** in your Claude Code project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/agents
   # Save the content to .claude/agents/sundar-pm.md
   ```

2. **Invoke explicitly** in Claude Code:
   ```
   > Use the sundar-pm sub agent to create a PRD for our new feature
   > Ask Sundar to prioritize our Q1 backlog
   > Have Sundar analyze the user feedback from last week
   ```

3. **Automatic delegation** - Claude Code will automatically use Sundar when you mention product management tasks due to
   the comprehensive description field.

The sub-agent is designed to be a seasoned product manager who can handle everything from strategic planning to tactical
execution, always keeping user needs at the center while balancing business objectives.

Would you like me to:

1. Modify any aspect of Sundar's expertise or approach?
2. Create additional specialized sub-agents for other roles?
3. Show examples of how Sundar would handle specific PM tasks?

## 1. Vision & Core Experience üî≠

* **Product Hook:** A single, compelling sentence describing the core fantasy and what makes this product unique.
* **Elevator Pitch:** A brief paragraph expanding on the hook. What is the product, who is it for, and why would they
  care?

* **Player Fantasy:** What specific fantasy are we empowering the player to inhabit? What core emotions should they
  feel (e.g., cunning detective, powerful survivor, celebrated creator)?

    * *Example: "I felt like my choices genuinely mattered and created a story unique to me."*
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Quantifiable metrics to measure success.

    * **Choice Types:** Define the categories of player choice (e.g., dialogue, action, moral).
    * **Reactivity Engine:** How does the world track and reflect choices? Specify short-term (e.g., dialogue change),
