## ***13. Developer Tools & Future Features***

1. *Dev Debug Workflow*

    - A *Timeline Viewer* plus *console commands* to jump frames or load states is planned.
    - Snapshots can be stored to quickly replay bug scenarios or test large-scale fights.


2. *In-Game Debug (Player-Facing)*

    - A simplified "replay" or "highlight reel" might be offered to players as a *P1* (post-core) feature.


3. *Potential RNG & Co-Op*

    - Small random elements (e.g., crits, random boss phases) may be introduced after launch.
    - Co-Op or synchronous multiplayer remains outside initial scope.


4. *Removed/Optional Concepts*

    - *Boss enrage timers* are removed from the final design.
    - Advanced multi-tap edge cases, boss scaling, or other expansions remain optional.
