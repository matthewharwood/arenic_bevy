## ***11. Progression, Rewards & Buffs***

1. *Leveling & De-Leveling* (Design Document §§9, 10)

    - Heroes gain levels through repeated success, both active and idle.
    - Each death causes a hero to lose one level.
    - Visual or audio cues indicate level-ups/downs.
    - The hero's historical level changes might be displayed in a "level history."


2. *Permanent Upgrades*

    - Boss kills in Normal/Heroic/Mythic can grant better gear or account-wide perks.
    - These do not invalidate older replays because there is no boss scaling.


3. *Global Buff Timers*

    - Buff stacking is allowed. If the *same* buff is applied at a higher tier, it overwrites the previous one.
    - *Different* buffs can stack in parallel.
    - Timers are displayed in a *single global HUD*.
