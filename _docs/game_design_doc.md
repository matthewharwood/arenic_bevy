## **PART 1 | INSPIRATION**

### **What Games Inspire You?**

| Game Name                   | Why Does This Game Inspire You?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **World of Warcraft**       | **MMORPG**: The raid mechanics, particularly the 40-man raids, serve as the core inspiration for this game. The coordination required between different roles (tanks, healers, DPS) and the satisfaction of executing complex strategies as a team provides the foundation for our solo interpretation of these mechanics.                                                                                                                        |
| **Hades**                   | **Realtime Rogue Lite**: Hades' roguelite progression system—particularly how it handles character death and upgrades—is a major influence. In **Arenic**, progress happens even in failure through various systems like permanent upgrades and our de-leveling/experience loss character system.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Mega Man Battle Network** | **Tactical RPG**: The grid combat system and predictable boss behaviors directly inform our mechanics. Its grid-based positioning merges with pattern recognition as bosses telegraph attacks by highlighting tiles, creating a dance of dodging hazards while exploiting attack windows. Players master both spatial awareness and boss patterns simultaneously, as grid modifications force movement while maintaining offensive opportunities. |
| **Soda Dungeon**            | **Idle RPG**: Recruiting characters and setting up automated dungeon runs serve as inspiration. Its progression system, where heroes auto-grind dungeons while collecting resources and unlocking new classes, informs our guild-building and automation features. Like Soda Dungeon, **Arenic** emphasizes team composition and optimization for idle progression.                                                                               |

## **PART 4 | GAME OVERVIEW**

### **Game Title**

**Arenic**

### **Super Short Description**

Command 8 simultaneous 40-person raids through hero recording and layering.

### **Short Description**

Build a guild of 320 heroes to master 8 simultaneous 40-person raids. Record and layer each hero's actions, grow
stronger through victory and defeat, and conquer interconnected arenas in this tactical raid simulator.

### **Long Description**

Build your Guild's power to command 8 simultaneous 40-person raids in this tactical raid simulator. Record each hero's
movements and abilities on a grid-based battlefield, then layer these recordings to create complex strategies.
Characters level up through idle progression and active raiding, but death causes de-leveling or permanent loss. Use
role coordination, pattern recognition, and positioning to optimize your 320-hero roster. Success requires mastering the
recording system and boss patterns while managing guild resources. Every attempt, win or lose, strengthens your guild
through permanent upgrades.

### **PLOT**

**Philosophical Anchors:**

- Carl Jung: “In all chaos, there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.”
- Friedrich Nietzsche: “One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.”

| Element               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hook**              | You start as the Guild Commander, trying to restore order to eight arenas, each shaped by a different hero role. At first, it feels simple: gather allies, defeat bosses, and claim victory. But small clues and strange comments hint that something bigger is going on behind the scenes.                                                            |
| **Setting**           | The world is made up of eight linked arenas: The Labyrinth (Trapper), The Crucible (Alchemist), The Rushlands (Sprinter), The Overgrowth (Gatherer), The Shadow Market (Thief), The Bastion (Tank), The Sanctum (Cardinal), and The Hoard (Collector). Each arena was once stable, but now it teeters between order and chaos.                         |
| **Protagonist**       | You appear to be the Guild Commander, a leader working hard to bring stability back to the arenas. Over time, you discover a twist: you are also the Architect, the one who created this unstable world. Your actions, meant to restore order, are actually your own way of fighting off boredom.                                                      |
| **Antagonist**        | Each of the eight arenas has a boss shaped by that arena’s hero style. These bosses aren’t truly evil—they’re natural forces challenging your attempts to bring balance. Their unpredictable moves keep you on your toes, making every encounter part comedy, part struggle.                                                                           |
| **Struggle**          | Deep down, the real fight is within yourself. Why keep trying if you know you set all this chaos in motion? As you face more challenges, you discover that even in messy situations, you can find patterns and meaning. Your persistence turns confusion into purpose.                                                                                 |
| **Gameplay Relation** | By learning each arena’s rules, improving your guild, and refining your strategies, you turn tricky battles into victories. Every win brings you closer to understanding the world you created—and every loss teaches you something new. As the Commander-Architect, you find meaning in the act of playing, turning disorder into a personal triumph. |

**Cohesive Plot Summary**:  
You start as the Guild Commander, building a roster of heroes to tackle eight chaotic arenas. Each arena’s boss and
environment reflect both a class archetype and a philosophical tension between chaos and order. Over time, the Echo
Guild’s commentary and subtle narrative clues hint that you are also The Architect, a cosmic being using this entire
scenario as a means of self-entertainment. The ultimate revelation is that the futility and humor of it all are
precisely what make it meaningful—an existential puzzle where controlling chaos and birthing new strategies become their
own reward.

---

### **CHARACTERS**

#### *The Protagonist (Guild Commander / The Architect)*

- **Overview**:  
  You start off thinking you’re just the Guild Commander, a skilled leader who can record and replay multiple heroes’
  actions to tackle tough challenges. Over time, you learn a surprising truth: you’re also the Architect, the one who
  created this entire world and introduced the chaos within it. The Commander is your disguise, hiding the Architect’s
  playful, sometimes dark sense of humor.

- **The Flaw**:  
  As the Architect, you know everything is a game you’ve invented. Deep down, you believe nothing really matters. Yet
  you keep playing—shaping strategies, beating bosses, and restoring order. You’re trying to find purpose in something
  you know is meaningless.

- **The Struggle**:  
  You juggle the actions of hundreds of heroes across eight different arenas, dealing with setbacks like characters
  losing levels and new waves of chaos. Managing this complexity mirrors the Architect’s own inner battle: trying to
  make sense of a world they themselves made chaotic.

#### *The Antagonists (The Bosses & Entropy)*

- **Overview**:  
  Each of the eight arenas has a unique boss that reflects its class style, but twisted by Entropy. These bosses
  include:

    1. The Hunter
    2. The Alchemist
    3. The Bard
    4. The Forager
    5. The Thief
    6. The Warrior
    7. The Cardinal
    8. The Merchant


- **Threat to Protagonist**:  
  These bosses challenge your plans, forcing you to refine your strategies and recordings. Every mistake costs you
  character levels or resources, creating a tug-of-war between chaos and your efforts to bring things under control.

- **Believability**:  
  Their attacks and personalities fit the theme of each arena. Facing them feels like solving a puzzle while putting on
  a show. Each boss has nods to the grand story, making them feel like integral parts of the world rather than random
  enemies.

#### *Minor Characters (The Echo Guild)*

- **Overview**:  
  The Echo Guild represents the voices of the recorded heroes and their emergent personalities. They provide comedic
  commentary, question the Architect’s motives, celebrate improbable victories, and lament bizarre deaths.

- **Purpose**:  
  They give the player social resonance in a single-player environment, reacting dynamically to success, failure, and
  the gradual reveal of the cosmic joke at hand.

- **Salts**:  
  Their commentary is laced with existential humor, often breaking the fourth wall to hint at the Architect’s true
  nature. Their presence heightens the sense that this entire scenario is a grand, absurd spectacle.

---

### **GENRE**

- **Primary Genre**: **Strategy (Tactical Strategy)**

    - **Description**: You plan and carry out complex raid battles. You lead multiple heroes, record their actions, and
      stack these recordings to overcome tough enemies. Success depends on careful positioning, smart timing, and good
      use of resources.
    - **Justify**: The main idea is to think before you act. Each fight is like a puzzle you must solve with strategy
      rather than quick reactions.


- **Secondary Genre**: **Role-Playing Game (RPG)**

    - **Description**: Along with strategy, you also improve your heroes. They gain new abilities, get better gear, and
      become stronger over time. You build a team that grows and changes as you play.
    - **Justify**: Upgrading heroes and seeing them progress makes the game personal and rewarding. You don’t just use
      strategy—the design also aims to get you invested in your characters’ growth.

---

### **TARGET AUDIENCE**

- **Age Group**: 25-40
- **Language**: English
- **Gender**: All
- **Taste**: Players who enjoy complex strategy games

---

### **REWARDS**

#### *Plot Rewards*

As players progress, they gradually uncover how the eight arenas fit together, each one a piece of a larger, hidden
pattern. Over time, they learn why these arenas exist and how their challenges connect, turning what seems like random
chaos into a meaningful design. Reaching higher difficulty tiers reveals more clues, giving the player a steady stream
of story insights and “aha” moments.

#### *Gameplay Rewards*

Players earn levels, gain new abilities, and find better gear for their heroes as they move forward. They watch their
recorded characters combine their efforts seamlessly, turning what was once a mess of separate actions into a finely
tuned team. Each improvement in the guild—whether it’s a new recruit, a clever ability combo, or a better strategy—feels
like a rewarding step toward total mastery of the recording and replay system.
