# Building Character Creation Systems in Bevy: A Complete Implementation Guide

*Estimated completion time: 45-60 minutes*

## Introduction: The Character Creation Kitchen

Picture a busy restaurant kitchen during dinner rush. The **head chef** (your main plugin) coordinates everything, **stations** (systems) handle specific tasks like prep and plating, **ingredients** (components) get organized into **dishes** (entities), and a **clipboard** (resources) tracks the current orders. This is exactly how Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS) works - and character creation is the perfect place to see this coordination in action.

In this tutorial, you'll build a complete character creation system that demonstrates modern Bevy patterns through a collaborative design approach. Four specialists contributed their expertise:

- **Calvin** (Game Designer): Visual layout and user experience design
- **Adam** (Narrative Designer): Thematic integration and character flavor
- **Damien** (Lighting Designer): Interactive feedback and visual polish
- **Jon** (Rust/Bevy Engineer): Technical architecture and implementation

By the end, you'll understand not just *how* to build character creation systems, but *why* each design decision was made and how different disciplines work together in game development.

### What You'll Build

A two-phase character creation system:
1. **Selection Phase**: Choose from 8 character classes in a 4×2 grid
2. **Naming Phase**: Enter a custom character name
3. **Transition**: Move seamlessly to the next game state

### Prerequisites

- Basic Rust knowledge (structs, enums, implementations)
- Familiarity with Bevy concepts (entities, components, systems)
- Understanding of game state patterns (helpful but not required)

## Chapter 1: Architecture Overview - Understanding the Blueprint

### Mental Model: The State Machine Restaurant

Think of your character creation system as a restaurant with two dining rooms:

```
Selection Room → Naming Room → Exit to Game
     ↓              ↓            ↓
  Grid Menu      Text Input   Adventure
```

Each "room" (state) has its own:
- **Furniture** (UI components)
- **Staff** (systems that handle logic)  
- **Rules** (what actions are valid)
- **Transitions** (how to move between rooms)

### Core Architecture Components

Let's examine the five fundamental pieces that make this system work:

#### 1. The Coordinator: CharacterCreatePlugin

```rust  
pub struct CharacterCreatePlugin;

impl Plugin for CharacterCreatePlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app
            .init_resource::<CharacterCreationState>()
            .add_systems(OnEnter(GameState::CharacterCreate), setup_character_create)
            .add_systems(Update, (
                handle_character_selection,
                handle_naming_input,
                update_card_hover_effects,
            ).run_if(in_state(GameState::CharacterCreate)))
            .add_systems(OnExit(GameState::CharacterCreate), cleanup_character_create);
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters**: The plugin acts as your "head chef," registering all the systems that need to run and when. The `run_if(in_state(...))` condition ensures systems only run when appropriate - like having prep cooks only work when orders come in.

#### 2. The Data Models: Character Classes and Creation State

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum CharacterClass {
    Trapper, Alchemist, Sprinter, Gatherer,
    Thief, Tank, Cardinal, Collector,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum CreationPhase {
    Selection,
    Naming(CharacterClass),
}

#[derive(Resource, Debug)]
struct CharacterCreationState {
    phase: CreationPhase,
    character_name: String,
}
```

**Design Insight**: Notice how `CreationPhase::Naming` carries the selected character class. This is a powerful Rust pattern called "state encoding" - the type system prevents you from being in an invalid state (like trying to name a character before selecting one).

#### 3. The Organization System: Component Markers

```rust
#[derive(Component)] struct CharacterCreateScreen;
#[derive(Component)] struct CharacterCard { class: CharacterClass }
#[derive(Component)] struct SelectableCard;
#[derive(Component)] struct HoverState { is_hovered: bool }
```

**Mental Model**: These are like colored tags in our restaurant kitchen. `CharacterCreateScreen` tags everything that belongs to this state (so we can clean up later), `CharacterCard` connects UI elements to their data, and `SelectableCard` marks interactive elements.

**Active Recall Challenge**: Before reading further, predict: Why do we need separate `CharacterCard` and `SelectableCard` components instead of just one?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Separation of concerns! `CharacterCard` holds data (which character this represents), while `SelectableCard` marks behavior (this can be clicked). This lets us query for "all cards with data" separately from "all interactive elements," making our systems more flexible and maintainable.
</details>

```

## Chapter 2: Building the Foundation - Data and State Management

### Step 1: Character Class Implementation

Let's start with the heart of our system - defining what character classes are available and how they present themselves:

```rust
impl CharacterClass {
    /// Get all character classes in grid order (4x2)
    pub fn all() -> [Self; 8] {
        [
            Self::Trapper, Self::Alchemist, Self::Sprinter, Self::Gatherer,
            Self::Thief, Self::Tank, Self::Cardinal, Self::Collector,
        ]
    }
    
    /// Get the display name for the character class
    pub fn display_name(self) -> &'static str {
        match self {
            Self::Trapper => "The Trapper",
            Self::Alchemist => "The Alchemist",
            // ... etc
        }
    }
    
    /// Adam's narrative taglines for each class
    pub fn tagline(self) -> &'static str {
        match self {
            Self::Trapper => "Set cunning snares, control the battlefield",
            Self::Alchemist => "Transform matter, brew ancient mysteries",
            // ... etc
        }
    }
    
    /// Get the asset path for the character icon
    pub fn texture_path(self) -> &'static str {
        match self {
            Self::Trapper => "bosses/trapper.png",
            Self::Alchemist => "bosses/alchemist.png",
            // ... etc
        }
    }
}
```

**Design Rationale**: 
- **Adam's Contribution**: Each tagline follows a pattern: "Action verb, consequence/flavor." This creates consistent voice while highlighting unique gameplay aspects.
- **Calvin's Contribution**: The `all()` method returns classes in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) for the 4×2 grid, ensuring logical visual flow.

**Verification Checkpoint**: Create a simple test to verify your character classes:

```rust
#[test]
fn character_classes_have_complete_data() {
    for class in CharacterClass::all() {
        assert!(!class.display_name().is_empty());
        assert!(!class.tagline().is_empty());
        assert!(class.texture_path().ends_with(".png"));
    }
}
```

### Step 2: State Machine Implementation

The creation state acts as our system's "memory":

```rust
#[derive(Resource, Debug)]
struct CharacterCreationState {
    phase: CreationPhase,
    character_name: String,
}

impl Default for CharacterCreationState {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            phase: CreationPhase::Selection,
            character_name: String::new(),
        }
    }
}
```

**Why Resources Instead of Components**: Resources are perfect for singleton data that many systems need to access. Think of it as the "clipboard" that gets passed around the kitchen - there's only one, and everyone needs to check it.

**Mental Model Check**: Can you explain why `CreationPhase::Naming(CharacterClass)` is better than having separate `phase: Phase` and `selected_class: Option<CharacterClass>` fields?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Type safety! With `Naming(CharacterClass)`, it's impossible to be in the naming phase without having a selected character. The `Option<CharacterClass>` approach could lead to bugs where you're naming but don't know which character was selected.
</details>

## Chapter 3: Visual Foundation - Setting Up the UI Framework

### Step 3: Calvin's Grid Layout System

Calvin designed a 4×2 grid that balances visual appeal with usability. Here's how we implement his vision:

```rust
fn setup_character_create(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    mut creation_state: ResMut<CharacterCreationState>,
) {
    // Reset creation state - crucial for re-entering the state
    *creation_state = CharacterCreationState::default();
    
    // Main container with Calvin's red background (#E3334B)
    commands.spawn((
        Node {
            width: Val::Percent(100.0),
            height: Val::Percent(100.0),
            justify_content: JustifyContent::Center,
            align_items: AlignItems::Center,
            flex_direction: FlexDirection::Column,
            ..default()
        },
        BackgroundColor(Color::srgb_u8(227, 51, 75)), // Calvin's brand red
        CharacterCreateScreen, // Cleanup marker
    )).with_children(|parent| {
        // Adam's narrative header
        parent.spawn((
            Text::new("Choose Your Path, Commander"),
            TextFont { font_size: 48.0, ..default() },
            TextColor(Color::WHITE),
            Node {
                margin: UiRect::bottom(Val::Px(40.0)),
                ..default()
            },
        ));
        
        // The grid container - Calvin's 4x2 layout
        parent.spawn((
            Node {
                display: Display::Grid,
                grid_template_columns: RepeatedGridTrack::flex(4, 1.0),
                grid_template_rows: RepeatedGridTrack::flex(2, 1.0),
                column_gap: Val::Px(24.0),
                row_gap: Val::Px(24.0),
                ..default()
            },
        )).with_children(|grid| {
            // Spawn all 8 character cards
            for class in CharacterClass::all() {
                spawn_character_card(grid, class, &asset_server);
            }
        });
    });
}
```

**Calvin's Design Decisions Explained**:
- **Color Psychology**: Red (#E3334B) creates urgency and importance - perfect for a major decision
- **4×2 Grid**: Fits naturally on both desktop and landscape mobile screens
- **24px Gaps**: Provides breathing room without feeling sparse
- **Centered Layout**: Creates focus and gravitas for this important choice

**CSS Grid in Bevy**: The `RepeatedGridTrack::flex(4, 1.0)` creates 4 equal-width columns that share the available space. This is equivalent to CSS `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)`.

### Step 4: Individual Character Cards

```rust
fn spawn_character_card(
    parent: &mut ChildSpawnerCommands,
    class: CharacterClass,
    asset_server: &AssetServer,
) {
    parent.spawn((
        Button, // Makes it interactive
        Node {
            width: Val::Px(200.0),  // Calvin's card dimensions
            height: Val::Px(160.0),
            border: UiRect::all(Val::Px(3.0)),
            justify_content: JustifyContent::Center,
            align_items: AlignItems::Center,
            flex_direction: FlexDirection::Column,
            ..default()
        },
        BackgroundColor(Color::WHITE), // Calvin's clean white cards
        BorderColor(Color::WHITE),
        HoverState { is_hovered: false }, // Damien's hover tracking
        CharacterCard { class }, // Data connection
        SelectableCard, // Behavior marker
    )).with_children(|card| {
        // Character icon (64x64 with bottom margin)
        card.spawn((
            ImageNode::new(asset_server.load(class.texture_path())),
            Node {
                width: Val::Px(64.0),
                height: Val::Px(64.0),
                margin: UiRect::bottom(Val::Px(8.0)),
                ..default()
            },
        ));
        
        // Character class name (main text)
        card.spawn((
            Text::new(class.display_name()),
            TextFont { font_size: 18.0, ..default() },
            TextColor(Color::BLACK),
            Node {
                margin: UiRect::bottom(Val::Px(4.0)),
                ..default()
            },
        ));
        
        // Adam's tagline (smaller, gray text)
        card.spawn((
            Text::new(class.tagline()),
            TextFont { font_size: 12.0, ..default() },
            TextColor(Color::srgb(0.4, 0.4, 0.4)),
            Node {
                margin: UiRect::horizontal(Val::Px(8.0)),
                ..default()
            },
        ));
    });
}
```

**Verification Checkpoint**: At this point, you should see 8 white cards arranged in a 4×2 grid on a red background. Run your game and verify:
- All 8 cards are visible
- Cards show character icons, names, and taglines
- Grid layout looks balanced and centered

**What's the Output?**: You should see something like:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Choose Your Path, Commander              │
│                                                     │
│  [Trapper] [Alchemist] [Sprinter] [Gatherer]      │
│   [Thief]    [Tank]   [Cardinal] [Collector]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Chapter 4: Interactive Behavior - Damien's Visual Feedback System

### Step 5: Implementing Hover Effects

Damien's hover system provides subtle but important feedback that makes the interface feel responsive:

```rust
/// Damien's lighting effects - update hover states and visual feedback
fn update_card_hover_effects(
    mut interaction_query: Query<
        (&Interaction, &mut BackgroundColor, &mut HoverState),
        (Changed<Interaction>, With<SelectableCard>)
    >,
) {
    for (interaction, mut bg_color, mut hover_state) in &mut interaction_query {
        match *interaction {
            Interaction::Hovered => {
                if !hover_state.is_hovered {
                    // Damien's hover effect - brighten to 1.0
                    *bg_color = BackgroundColor(Color::srgb(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));
                    hover_state.is_hovered = true;
                }
            }
            Interaction::None => {
                if hover_state.is_hovered {
                    // Return to base brightness 0.92
                    *bg_color = BackgroundColor(Color::srgb(0.92, 0.92, 0.92));
                    hover_state.is_hovered = false;
                }
            }
            _ => {} // Pressed state handled elsewhere
        }
    }
}
```

**Damien's Design Philosophy**: 
- **Subtle Changes**: The difference between 0.92 and 1.0 brightness is noticeable but not jarring
- **State Tracking**: We only update when state actually changes, preventing unnecessary work
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users instantly know what they can interact with

**Technical Deep-Dive**: The `Changed<Interaction>` filter ensures this system only runs when interaction states actually change, not every frame. This is a crucial optimization in Bevy.

**Active Recall Challenge**: Why do we need both `Interaction` and `HoverState` components?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`Interaction` is Bevy's built-in component that tracks mouse/touch state, but it doesn't remember our custom visual state. `HoverState` lets us track whether we've already applied the hover effect, preventing unnecessary updates on every frame while hovering.
</details>

### Step 6: Selection Logic

Now let's handle what happens when users click on cards:

```rust
fn handle_character_selection(
    mut interaction_query: Query<
        (&Interaction, &CharacterCard),
        (Changed<Interaction>, With<Button>)
    >,
    mut creation_state: ResMut<CharacterCreationState>,
    mut commands: Commands,
    screen_query: Query<Entity, With<CharacterCreateScreen>>,
) {
    // Only process selection during Selection phase
    if !matches!(creation_state.phase, CreationPhase::Selection) {
        return;
    }
    
    for (interaction, card) in &mut interaction_query {
        if *interaction == Interaction::Pressed {
            // Move to naming phase
            creation_state.phase = CreationPhase::Naming(card.class);
            creation_state.character_name.clear();
            
            // Clear current UI and setup naming interface
            for entity in &screen_query {
                commands.entity(entity).despawn();
            }
            
            setup_naming_interface(&mut commands, card.class);
            break; // Only handle one selection per frame
        }
    }
}
```

**Important Pattern**: Notice the guard clause at the beginning - we only process selections when in the Selection phase. This prevents bugs where you might accidentally register clicks during other phases.

**Verification Checkpoint**: Test your selection system:
1. Hover over cards - they should brighten slightly
2. Click a card - it should transition to the naming interface
3. The red background should remain consistent

## Chapter 5: The Naming Phase - Keyboard Input and Text Processing

### Step 7: Naming Interface Setup

When a character is selected, we transition to a text input interface:

```rust
fn setup_naming_interface(commands: &mut Commands, selected_class: CharacterClass) {
    commands.spawn((
        Node {
            width: Val::Percent(100.0),
            height: Val::Percent(100.0),
            justify_content: JustifyContent::Center,
            align_items: AlignItems::Center,
            flex_direction: FlexDirection::Column,
            ..default()
        },
        BackgroundColor(Color::srgb_u8(227, 51, 75)), // Keep Calvin's red
        CharacterCreateScreen, // Same cleanup marker
    )).with_children(|parent| {
        // Adam's contextual narrative
        parent.spawn((
            Text::new(format!("Your {} awaits a name, Commander", 
                             selected_class.display_name())),
            TextFont { font_size: 36.0, ..default() },
            TextColor(Color::WHITE),
            Node {
                margin: UiRect::bottom(Val::Px(30.0)),
                ..default()
            },
        ));
        
        // Visual input field representation
        parent.spawn((
            Node {
                width: Val::Px(400.0),
                height: Val::Px(50.0),
                border: UiRect::all(Val::Px(2.0)),
                justify_content: JustifyContent::Center,
                align_items: AlignItems::Center,
                margin: UiRect::bottom(Val::Px(20.0)),
                ..default()
            },
            BackgroundColor(Color::WHITE),
            BorderColor(Color::srgb(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)),
        )).with_children(|input_field| {
            input_field.spawn((
                Text::new("Type your character name..."),
                TextFont { font_size: 18.0, ..default() },
                TextColor(Color::srgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)), // Placeholder gray
            ));
        });
        
        // Clear instructions
        parent.spawn((
            Text::new("Type your name and press ENTER to begin your journey"),
            TextFont { font_size: 16.0, ..default() },
            TextColor(Color::srgb(0.9, 0.9, 0.9)),
        ));
    });
}
```

**Adam's Narrative Integration**: Notice how the text adapts to the selected character - "Your Alchemist awaits a name" creates personal investment in the choice.

### Step 8: Keyboard Input Handling

This is where Jon's technical expertise really shines - handling real-time keyboard input in Bevy:

```rust
fn handle_naming_input(
    keyboard: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>,
    mut keyboard_events: EventReader<KeyboardInput>,
    mut creation_state: ResMut<CharacterCreationState>,
    mut next_state: ResMut<NextState<GameState>>,
    mut text_query: Query<&mut Text>,
) {
    if let CreationPhase::Naming(_selected_class) = creation_state.phase {
        // Handle character input
        for event in keyboard_events.read() {
            if let KeyboardInput { 
                logical_key: Key::Character(ch), 
                state: ButtonState::Pressed, 
                .. 
            } = event {
                let ch = ch.chars().next().unwrap_or(' ');
                if (ch.is_alphanumeric() || ch == ' ') && creation_state.character_name.len() < 20 {
                    creation_state.character_name.push(ch);
                    update_input_display(&mut text_query, &creation_state);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Handle backspace
        if keyboard.just_pressed(KeyCode::Backspace) && !creation_state.character_name.is_empty() {
            creation_state.character_name.pop();
            update_input_display(&mut text_query, &creation_state);
        }
        
        // Handle Enter to complete character creation
        if keyboard.just_pressed(KeyCode::Enter) && !creation_state.character_name.trim().is_empty() {
            // Transition to next state
            next_state.set(GameState::Intro);
        }
    }
}

fn update_input_display(text_query: &mut Query<&mut Text>, creation_state: &CharacterCreationState) {
    for mut text in text_query {
        if text.0 == "Type your character name..." || !creation_state.character_name.is_empty() {
            text.0 = if creation_state.character_name.is_empty() {
                "Type your character name...".to_string()
            } else {
                creation_state.character_name.clone()
            };
        }
    }
}
```

**Technical Insights**:
- **Event vs Resource**: We use `EventReader<KeyboardInput>` for individual keystrokes but `ButtonInput<KeyCode>` for special keys like Enter and Backspace
- **Input Validation**: Only alphanumeric characters and spaces, with a 20-character limit
- **Placeholder Logic**: The display switches between placeholder text and actual input

**Verification Checkpoint**: Test the naming system:
1. Select a character class
2. Type a name - it should appear in the input field
3. Use backspace to edit
4. Press Enter with a valid name - should transition to Intro state

## Chapter 6: Cleanup and Resource Management

### Step 9: Proper Cleanup

Jon implemented a crucial but often overlooked aspect - proper cleanup:

```rust
fn cleanup_character_create(
    mut commands: Commands,
    query: Query<Entity, With<CharacterCreateScreen>>,
) {
    for entity in &query {
        commands.entity(entity).despawn();
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Without cleanup, entities from the character creation screen would persist in memory even after transitioning to other states. The `CharacterCreateScreen` component acts as a "tag" that lets us find and remove all related entities.

**Mental Model**: Think of this like cleaning up after your restaurant shift - you wouldn't leave dirty dishes and prep materials out for the next day's service.

## Chapter 7: Integration and Testing

### Step 10: Plugin Integration

Make sure your plugin is properly registered in your main game:

```rust
// In your main.rs or app setup
app.add_plugins(CharacterCreatePlugin);
```

### Step 11: Complete System Test

Create a comprehensive test to verify your entire system:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use bevy::app::App;
    
    #[test]
    fn character_creation_system_integration() {
        let mut app = App::new();
        app.add_plugins(CharacterCreatePlugin);
        
        // Test that all systems are registered
        assert!(app.world.contains_resource::<CharacterCreationState>());
        
        // Test character class completeness
        for class in CharacterClass::all() {
            assert!(!class.display_name().is_empty());
            assert!(!class.tagline().is_empty());
            assert!(class.texture_path().contains("bosses/"));
        }
    }
}
```

## Chapter 8: Design Rationale Deep-Dive

### Calvin's Game Design Decisions

**Color Psychology in Action**:
- **Red Background (#E3334B)**: Creates urgency and importance, signaling this is a significant decision
- **White Cards**: High contrast ensures readability, suggests "clean slate" for new characters
- **4×2 Grid**: Optimal for scanning - users naturally read left-to-right, top-to-bottom

**Usability Principles**:
- **Card Size (200×160px)**: Large enough for clear icons and text, small enough to see all options at once
- **24px Gaps**: Prevents mis-clicks while maintaining visual grouping
- **Consistent Layout**: Same visual hierarchy across all cards reduces cognitive load

### Adam's Narrative Integration

**Echo Guild Theming**:
- **Military Address**: "Commander" establishes player's role and importance
- **Tagline Pattern**: Each follows "Action verb, consequence" structure for consistency
- **Character Agency**: "Choose Your Path" emphasizes player agency over predetermined fate

**Emotional Engagement**:
- **Personal Investment**: "Your [Class] awaits a name" creates ownership
- **Progressive Revelation**: Information revealed in logical sequence builds anticipation

### Damien's Visual Feedback Philosophy

**Micro-Interactions Matter**:
- **Subtle Hover Effects**: 0.92 to 1.0 brightness provides feedback without distraction
- **Immediate Response**: Visual changes happen instantly, maintaining connection between action and result
- **State Preservation**: Hover state tracking prevents visual flicker

**Accessibility Considerations**:
- **High Contrast**: White text on red background meets WCAG guidelines
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Font sizes create obvious importance levels
- **Consistent Interaction Patterns**: All selectable elements respond the same way

### Jon's Technical Architecture

**Modern Bevy Patterns**:
- **State-Driven Design**: Systems only run when appropriate, preventing bugs and improving performance
- **Component Markers**: Enable flexible queries and clean separation of concerns
- **Resource Management**: Centralized state prevents data inconsistencies

**Performance Considerations**:
- **Change Detection**: `Changed<Interaction>` filters prevent unnecessary work
- **Batch Operations**: UI spawning happens in single frame, preventing visual glitches
- **Proper Cleanup**: Prevents memory leaks and entity bloat

## Chapter 9: Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Cards Not Responding to Clicks

**Symptoms**: Cards show hover effects but don't transition to naming phase

**Causes & Solutions**:
- **Missing Button Component**: Ensure `Button` component is on card entities
- **Wrong Query Filter**: Check that `handle_character_selection` includes `With<Button>`
- **State Mismatch**: Verify system only runs in `CreationPhase::Selection`

**Debug Test**:
```rust
// Add this to your selection handler for debugging
println!("Selection phase: {:?}, Interaction: {:?}", 
         creation_state.phase, interaction);
```

### Issue 2: Text Input Not Working

**Symptoms**: Typing doesn't update the name field

**Causes & Solutions**:
- **Event System**: Make sure you're reading from `EventReader<KeyboardInput>`
- **Phase Check**: Verify you're in `CreationPhase::Naming`
- **Text Query**: Ensure the text query finds the correct text entity

**Debug Test**:
```rust
// Add to naming handler
println!("Character name: '{}', Key pressed: {:?}", 
         creation_state.character_name, event);
```

### Issue 3: Visual Artifacts or Flickering

**Symptoms**: UI elements appear/disappear rapidly

**Causes & Solutions**:
- **Multiple Systems**: Check for conflicting systems modifying the same components
- **Frame Timing**: Ensure setup happens in `OnEnter` not `Update`
- **Entity Despawning**: Verify cleanup happens in `OnExit`

### Issue 4: Memory Leaks or Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: Game slows down over time or memory usage increases

**Causes & Solutions**:
- **Missing Cleanup**: Ensure `cleanup_character_create` runs on state exit
- **Resource Accumulation**: Reset resources properly in setup
- **Entity Proliferation**: Use `CharacterCreateScreen` marker for bulk cleanup

### Learning Artifacts

**Flashcard Deck**: Key Concepts to Remember

| Front | Back |
|-------|------|
| What is the purpose of component markers? | To enable flexible queries and organize entities by function |
| Why use `run_if(in_state(...))` on systems? | To ensure systems only run when appropriate, preventing bugs |
| When should you use Resources vs Components? | Resources for singleton data, Components for entity-specific data |
| What's the benefit of enum state encoding? | Type safety - impossible to be in invalid states |

**Reference Checklist**: Character Creation System

- [ ] Plugin registers all systems with correct run conditions
- [ ] Character classes have complete data (name, tagline, texture)
- [ ] State machine prevents invalid transitions
- [ ] UI spawns and despawns cleanly
- [ ] Input validation prevents invalid names
- [ ] Hover effects provide clear visual feedback
- [ ] All entities have proper cleanup markers
- [ ] System queries use appropriate filters

**Architecture Template**: Reusable for Other States

```rust
// 1. Define your plugin
pub struct [State]Plugin;

// 2. Define your data models
#[derive(Resource)] struct [State]Data { ... }
enum [State]Phase { ... }

// 3. Define your components
#[derive(Component)] struct [State]Screen;
#[derive(Component)] struct [Behavior]Marker;

// 4. Implement the plugin pattern
impl Plugin for [State]Plugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.init_resource::<[State]Data>()
           .add_systems(OnEnter(...), setup_[state])
           .add_systems(Update, (...).run_if(in_state(...)))
           .add_systems(OnExit(...), cleanup_[state]);
    }
}
```
