Excellent question! You're pushing into some really elegant Rust patterns here. Let me show you several approaches that
progressively get more sophisticated and chainable.

## The Challenge We're Facing

The core issue is that we need the collected `Vec` for multiple operations (finding the current position, calculating
the next index), but we also want to handle the empty case elegantly. In functional programming terms, we want to chain
operations while handling the possibility of failure. This is exactly what Rust's `Option` and `Result` types are
designed for!

## Approach 1: Using Option Chaining with a Helper Method

Let's start by wrapping our vector creation in an Option-returning function that handles the empty case:

```rust
fn select_active_character_chainable_v1(
    keyboard_input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
    arena_query: Single<&Children, (With<Active>, With<Arena>)>,
    active_character: Single<Entity, (With<Character>, With<Active>)>,
    character_query: Query<Entity, With<Character>>,
) {
    if !keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Tab) {
        return;
    }

    let arena_children = arena_query.into_inner();
    let current_active_entity = active_character.into_inner();

    // Create a helper closure that returns None for empty collections
    let non_empty = |v: Vec<Entity>| if v.is_empty() { None } else { Some(v) };

    // Now we can chain everything!
    let next_character = character_query
        .iter_many(arena_children)
        .collect::<Vec<_>>()
        .pipe(non_empty)  // Note: pipe doesn't exist in std, but I'll show you how to add it!
        .and_then(|chars| {
            chars.iter()
                .position(|&e| e == current_active_entity)
                .map(|idx| chars[(idx + 1) % chars.len()])
        });

    if let Some(next) = next_character {
        commands.entity(current_active_entity).remove::<Active>();
        commands.entity(next).insert(Active);
    } else {
        error!("No characters in active arena or active character not found!");
    }
}
```

But wait, Rust doesn't have a `pipe` method by default! Let me show you how to add one:

```rust
// Add this trait to your codebase - it's incredibly useful!
trait Pipe: Sized {
    fn pipe<R>(self, f: impl FnOnce(Self) -> R) -> R {
        f(self)
    }
}

// Implement it for all types
impl<T> Pipe for T {}
```

## Approach 2: Using Iterator's Cycle for Elegant Wraparound

Here's a beautiful pattern that uses `cycle()` to handle the wraparound automatically:

```rust
fn select_active_character_cycle_approach(
    keyboard_input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
    arena_query: Single<&Children, (With<Active>, With<Arena>)>,
    active_character: Single<Entity, (With<Character>, With<Active>)>,
    character_query: Query<Entity, With<Character>>,
) {
    if !keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Tab) {
        return;
    }

    let arena_children = arena_query.into_inner();
    let current_active_entity = active_character.into_inner();

    // Collect once to check if empty and get the vec
    let characters: Vec<Entity> = character_query
        .iter_many(arena_children)
        .collect();

    // Use cycle() and skip_while() for elegant wraparound!
    // This creates an infinite iterator that repeats the character list
    let next = characters
        .iter()
        .cycle()
        .skip_while(|&&e| e != current_active_entity)
        .nth(1)  // Get the element after the current one
        .filter(|_| !characters.is_empty());  // Safety check

    match next {
        Some(&next_entity) => {
            commands.entity(current_active_entity).remove::<Active>();
            commands.entity(next_entity).insert(Active);
        }
        None => error!("No characters in active arena!"),
    }
}
```

The beauty of this approach is that `cycle()` creates an infinite iterator that repeats your character list forever. We
skip to the current character, then take the next one. The wraparound happens automatically because `cycle()` starts
over when it reaches the end!

## Approach 3: Custom Extension Trait for Maximum Elegance

If you want the absolute cleanest API, let's create a custom extension trait:

```rust
// First, create an extension trait for iterators of entities
trait EntityIteratorExt: Iterator<Item=Entity> + Sized {
    /// Collects entities and returns None if empty, Some(vec) otherwise
    fn collect_non_empty(self) -> Option<Vec<Entity>> {
        let vec: Vec<Entity> = self.collect();
        (!vec.is_empty()).then_some(vec)
    }

    /// Finds the next entity in a cycle after the given current entity
    fn find_next_cyclic(self, current: Entity) -> Option<Entity> {
        let entities: Vec<Entity> = self.collect();

        entities
            .iter()
            .position(|&e| e == current)
            .map(|idx| entities[(idx + 1) % entities.len()])
            .or_else(|| entities.first().copied())  // Fallback to first if current not found
    }
}

// Implement for all iterators that yield entities
impl<I> EntityIteratorExt for I
where
    I: Iterator<Item=Entity>
{}

// Now your system becomes incredibly clean:
fn select_active_character_ultra_clean(
    keyboard_input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
    arena_query: Single<&Children, (With<Active>, With<Arena>)>,
    active_character: Single<Entity, (With<Character>, With<Active>)>,
    character_query: Query<Entity, With<Character>>,
) {
    if !keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Tab) {
        return;
    }

    let current = active_character.into_inner();

    // Look how clean this is!
    if let Some(next) = character_query
        .iter_many(arena_query.into_inner())
        .find_next_cyclic(current)
    {
        commands.entity(current).remove::<Active>();
        commands.entity(next).insert(Active);
    } else {
        error!("No characters found in active arena!");
    }
}
```

## Approach 4: The Try Pattern with Early Return

Here's a pattern using Rust's `?` operator for the cleanest error handling:

```rust
// Helper function that returns Result for use with ?
fn get_next_character(
    children: &Children,
    current: Entity,
    character_query: &Query<Entity, With<Character>>,
) -> Result<Entity, &'static str> {
    let characters: Vec<Entity> = character_query
        .iter_many(children)
        .collect();

    if characters.is_empty() {
        return Err("No characters in arena");
    }

    characters
        .iter()
        .position(|&e| e == current)
        .map(|idx| characters[(idx + 1) % characters.len()])
        .ok_or("Current character not in arena")
}

fn select_active_character_try_pattern(
    keyboard_input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
    arena_query: Single<&Children, (With<Active>, With<Arena>)>,
    active_character: Single<Entity, (With<Character>, With<Active>)>,
    character_query: Query<Entity, With<Character>>,
) {
    if !keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Tab) {
        return;
    }

    let current = active_character.into_inner();

    // Use a closure to enable the ? operator
    let result = (|| {
        let next = get_next_character(
            arena_query.into_inner(),
            current,
            &character_query
        )?;

        commands.entity(current).remove::<Active>();
        commands.entity(next).insert(Active);
        Ok::<(), &'static str>(())
    })();

    if let Err(e) = result {
        error!("{}", e);
    }
}
```

## The Deep Insight: Why Perfect Chaining Is Tricky Here

The reason we can't make this perfectly chainable in a single expression is that we need the vector in multiple places.
We need it to check if it's empty, to find the current position, and to get the next entity. In pure functional
programming languages, this would be handled with monadic binding, but Rust takes a more pragmatic approach.

The closest we can get to pure chaining is with the custom extension trait (Approach 3), which encapsulates all the
complex logic into a single method. This is actually a common pattern in Rust - when you find yourself writing the same
complex chain multiple times, wrap it in an extension trait method.

## My Recommendation

For your specific case, I'd recommend the **cycle() approach** (Approach 2) or the **custom extension trait** (Approach
3) depending on how often you'll use this pattern:

- Use the cycle() approach if this is a one-off system - it's elegant and requires no additional code
- Use the extension trait if you'll have multiple systems that need similar cycling behavior

Both approaches turn what could be error-prone index manipulation into clear, expressive code that communicates intent.
The cycle() approach especially reads almost like English: "cycle through the characters, skip to the current one, then
take the next."

Remember, elegance in Rust often means finding the right abstraction level. Sometimes that's a simple method, sometimes
it's an extension trait, and sometimes it's accepting that a few lines of clear, explicit code is better than a complex
one-liner!
