1. *Recording Sessions*

    - Press *R* to begin recording a 2-minute timeline for the selected character in the active arena.
    - A *3-second* countdown may appear before the clock starts.
    - Press *F* to finalize the recording, turning it into a “ghost.”


2. *Cancels & Partial Use*

    - If you cancel before finalizing, new data is discarded, and the arena’s timer resets to *0*.
    - If you finalize early (say at 1:00), the hero idles from 1:00 to 2:00 in that timeline.


3. *2-Minute Duration & Idle*

    - The maximum recording length is *2 minutes*.
    - If the player stops input after 1 minute but still finalizes, the timeline includes 1 minute of action \+ 1 minute
      of idle.


4. *Layered Timelines*

    - Each completed recording is a “ghost” that replays every 2-minute cycle.
    - You can layer up to *40* hero recordings in one arena, all in parallel.
    - Over time, you build massive raids by synchronizing multiple ghosts.


5. *Death & Revival in the Timeline*

    - If a hero dies at a certain timestamp in their recorded run, that death recurs in replays (unless you record a new
      run to alter that outcome).
    - Revival spells must target a specific grid cell/time. If the hero’s corpse is there during that cast, they get
      revived.


6. *No Rewind*

    - Once you finalize a recorded timeline, it’s immutable.
    - For a different outcome, record a new session.
