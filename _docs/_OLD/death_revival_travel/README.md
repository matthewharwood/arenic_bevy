## ***6. Death, Revival & Travel***

1. *Death*

    - HP=0 â†’ immediate removal from that arena's rotation \+ lose 1 level.
    - Timelines store the exact death moment for replays.


2. *Revival*

    - Revival spells target a grid cell and time. If a dead hero is at that cell/time, they come back to life.
    - Otherwise, the attempt fails (a "revive miss").


3. *Travel & Offscreen Combat*

    - Heroes traveling between arenas (or from the Guild House) can die offscreen if attacked.
    - Death offscreen also triggers a de-level and reverts them to the Guild House.
    - No mini-instance or separate recording for travel; it's background-simulated.
