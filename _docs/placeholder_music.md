# ARENIC: Placeholder Music Selection Guide

## Overview
This document provides carefully curated placeholder music selections for Arenic's title screen and 9 arenas. All tracks are selected for harmonic compatibility to enable smooth crossfading between arenas as players transition seamlessly through the 3×3 grid layout.

## Musical Design Philosophy

### Core Requirements
- **Harmonic Compatibility**: All tracks share compatible key signatures (primarily D minor/F major family)
- **Consistent BPM Range**: 120-140 BPM for smooth tempo transitions
- **Unified Orchestral Palette**: Consistent instrumentation across all tracks
- **Dynamic Range Matching**: Similar energy levels to prevent jarring transitions
- **Thematic Cohesion**: Epic orchestral/hybrid electronic style throughout

| Title→Any | 3 seconds | D minor base | ★★★★★ |
| Labyrinth↔Guild House | 2 seconds | Shared D minor | ★★★★★ |
| Guild House↔Sanctum | 2 seconds | D min→A min (v) | ★★★★☆ |

### Implementation Notes

1. **Crossfade Algorithm**: Use equal-power crossfade curve for 2-3 second transitions
2. **Frequency Matching**: Apply subtle high-pass filter during transitions to prevent mud
3. **Rhythmic Sync**: Quantize transition points to nearest beat for rhythmic continuity
4. **Dynamic Normalization**: Match RMS levels between tracks to prevent volume jumps
5. **Reverb Tail**: Maintain consistent reverb space across all tracks

## Final Notes

This selection prioritizes harmonic compatibility and smooth transitions while maintaining each arena's unique character. The D minor tonal center acts as a gravitational force that keeps all tracks related, while the various modal interchanges (F major, A minor, G minor, etc.) provide variety without breaking cohesion.

The crossfade system should feel like one massive, dynamic composition that shifts and evolves as players navigate the arena grid, enhancing the feeling that all 9 arenas are part of one interconnected battlefield.
