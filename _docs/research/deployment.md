‚è∫ To become an expert in this GitHub Actions release workflow for game development, you need comprehensive
knowledge across multiple technology domains. Here's your learning roadmap:

1. GitHub Actions & CI/CD

- Workflow syntax and lifecycle: triggers, jobs, steps, outputs
- Concurrency control and job dependencies
- Matrix strategies for multi-platform builds
- Secrets and environment variable management
- Artifact management and caching strategies
- Composite actions and reusable workflows

2. Rust Development Ecosystem

- Cargo build system: workspaces, features, profiles, target triples
- Cross-compilation: understanding target specifications (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, aarch64-apple-darwin)
- Rustflags and optimization: -Zthreads=0, -Zshare-generics, link-time optimization
- Cargo-binstall: binary installation vs compilation trade-offs
- Rust toolchain management: stable vs nightly features

3. Bevy Game Engine

- Bevy CLI tools: build commands, bundling, asset processing
- Feature flags in Bevy: conditional compilation for platforms
- Asset pipeline: how Bevy handles resources across platforms
- Performance optimization for games
- Bevy's WebAssembly support

4. WebAssembly (WASM)

- wasm-bindgen: JavaScript/WASM interop, web APIs
- wasm-opt: optimization levels, size vs performance trade-offs
- Web bundling: serving WASM files, loading strategies
- Browser compatibility and polyfills
- WASM debugging and profiling

5. Platform-Specific Packaging

macOS

- Universal binaries: lipo tool, fat binaries for Intel/ARM
- DMG creation: hdiutil, filesystem types (HFS+)
- Info.plist structure: CFBundle keys, versioning
- Code signing and notarization (not shown but critical)
- macOS deployment targets and SDK management

Windows

- MSVC toolchain: Visual Studio build tools
- PowerShell compression: Compress-Archive cmdlet
- Windows executables: PE format, manifests
- Windows signing (not shown but important)

Linux

- System dependencies: libasound2-dev (audio), libudev-dev (device management)
- Wayland vs X11: display server protocols
- AppImage/Flatpak (alternative packaging not shown)

6. Game Distribution Platforms

itch.io

- Butler CLI: pushing builds, channel management
- Butler API: authentication, versioning
- Channel naming conventions: platform targeting
- itch.io app integration

GitHub Releases

- Release API: svenstaro/upload-release-action
- Asset management: overwriting, naming conventions
- Tag-based versioning

7. Shell Scripting & Cross-Platform Development

- Bash scripting: conditionals, variable expansion, heredocs
- PowerShell basics: for Windows-specific tasks
- Cross-platform path handling
- Environment detection and conditional execution

8. Version Control & Large Files

- Git LFS: bandwidth costs, quota management
- Git refs and tags: version extraction from refs
- Conventional commits and semantic versioning

9. Build Optimization

- Rust incremental compilation
- GitHub Actions cache: Swatinem/rust-cache configuration
- Build parallelization strategies
- Binary size optimization techniques

10. Security Best Practices

- Secrets management: BUTLER_CREDENTIALS, GITHUB_TOKEN
- Permission scoping: minimal required permissions
- Supply chain security: locked dependencies
- Code signing (implement for production)

Critical Deep-Dive Areas

For Production Readiness:

1. Implement code signing for all platforms
2. Add automated testing before release
3. Configure Steam/Epic Games Store deployment
4. Set up crash reporting and telemetry
5. Implement rollback strategies

Performance Optimization:

1. Profile-guided optimization (PGO)
2. Link-time optimization (LTO)
3. Binary stripping and compression
4. Asset optimization pipelines

Monitoring & Analytics:

1. Build time metrics
2. Package size tracking
3. Download/install analytics
4. Error rate monitoring

This workflow represents modern game deployment practices. Master each area systematically, starting
with GitHub Actions fundamentals, then Rust/Bevy specifics, finally platform packaging details.
