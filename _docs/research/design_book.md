# PART 1 | INSPIRATION

## **WHAT GAMES INSPIRE YOU?**

Name **three or more games** that you are currently inspired by, and that you feel comfortable replicating to some degree. These can be included in the games provided to you, but can include any others as well! Be sure these games are successful! **Good rule of thumb:** if they have a thousand or more reviews, and a Very Positive score on Steam, you should list them!

- **Game Name**: Game Name 1 [Lorem Ipsum Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/592480/Knights_And_Bikes/); **Why Does This Game Inspire You? Anything Goes!**: Write why here. Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. It looks like this: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque pulvinar augue quis arcu consectetur, et fermentum ante faucibus. Nunc semper, sem et ultricies tempus, lectus felis volutpat libero, sed efficitur ligula lectus vitae dolor.
- **Game Name**: Game Name 2 [Lorem Ipsum Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/592480/Knights_And_Bikes/); **Why Does This Game Inspire You? Anything Goes!**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque pulvinar augue quis arcu consectetur, et fermentum ante faucibus. Nunc semper, sem et ultricies tempus, lectus felis volutpat libero, sed efficitur ligula lectus vitae dolor.
- **Game Name**: Game Name 3 [Lorem Ipsum Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/592480/Knights_And_Bikes/); **Why Does This Game Inspire You? Anything Goes!**: Etiam nec ex dictum lacus condimentum facilisis at non felis. Morbi neque urna, maximus sit amet facilisis et, ullamcorper a nibh. Nunc et libero venenatis, blandit velit nec, mattis tellus. Mauris eu imperdiet nibh, et pretium elit. Phasellus nec viverra quam. Morbi ac orci pharetra, laoreet nunc ut, mattis massa. Vestibulum congue felis sit amet auctor tincidunt. Nunc ultrices nulla ac eleifend imperdiet. Integer lorem ipsum, auctor a ultrices id, blandit a lorem.

## **TRAILER STUDY**

Now it’s time to study the **games’ trailers**. Using the three games above, find their trailers on YouTube, provide a link, and explain why the trailer seems to immediately **hook the audience**, or perhaps, why it doesn’t! A hook should happen immediately when the trailer starts. Read the comments to see if this is the case! 

- **Game Name**: Game Name 1 [Trailer Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXjXTbYQq5s); **Why Does It Hook The Audience Immediately?**: Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. It looks like this: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque pulvinar augue quis arcu consectetur, et fermentum ante faucibus. Nunc semper, sem et ultricies tempus, lectus felis volutpat libero, sed efficitur ligula lectus vitae dolor.
- **Game Name**: Game Name 2 [Trailer Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXjXTbYQq5s); **Why Does It Hook The Audience Immediately?**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque pulvinar augue quis arcu consectetur, et fermentum ante faucibus. Nunc semper, sem et ultricies tempus, lectus felis volutpat libero, sed efficitur ligula lectus vitae dolor.
- **Game Name**: Game Name 3 [Trailer Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXjXTbYQq5s); **Why Does It Hook The Audience Immediately?**: Etiam nec ex dictum lacus condimentum facilisis at non felis. Morbi neque urna, maximus sit amet facilisis et, ullamcorper a nibh. Nunc et libero venenatis, blandit velit nec, mattis tellus. Mauris eu imperdiet nibh, et pretium elit. Phasellus nec viverra quam. Morbi ac orci pharetra, laoreet nunc ut, mattis massa. Vestibulum congue felis sit amet auctor tincidunt. Nunc ultrices nulla ac eleifend imperdiet. Integer lorem ipsum, auctor a ultrices id, blandit a lorem.

## **CORE GAME LOOP STUDY**

Now let’s study the **Core Game Loop (and the primary mechanic that drives the player through the loop) of each game**! Remember, an effective (or “sticky”) Core Game Loop is **familiar**, **unique**, and **memorable**. Try and identify those three traits. 

- **Game Name**: Game Name 1; **What’s The Core Game Loop?**: Lorem Ipsum Solar En Demite ➜ Nunc et libero ➜  Pellentesque pulvinar augue quis; **What’s The Primary Mechanic?**: Example: Hack and slashing enemies as you explore caverns!; **Why Is It Sticky?**: It is **familiar** in that it is fermentum ante faucibus. It is **unique** in that nunc semper, sem et ultricies tempus, lectus felis volutpat libero, sed efficitur ligula lectus vitae dolor. It is **memorable** in that neque urna, maximus sit amet facilisis et, ullamcorper a nibh.
- **Game Name**: Game Name 2; **What’s The Core Game Loop?**: Lorem Ipsum Solar En Demite ➜ Nunc et libero ➜  Pellentesque pulvinar augue quis; **What’s The Primary Mechanic?**: Example: Shoot zombies while standing completely still!; **Why Is It Sticky?**: It is **familiar** in that it is fermentum ante faucibus. It is **unique** in that nunc semper, sem et ultricies tempus, lectus felis volutpat libero, sed efficitur ligula lectus vitae dolor. It is **memorable** in that neque urna, maximus sit amet facilisis et, ullamcorper a nibh.
- **Game Name**: Game Name 3; **What’s The Core Game Loop?**: Lorem Ipsum Solar En Demite ➜ Nunc et libero ➜  Pellentesque pulvinar augue quis; **What’s The Primary Mechanic?**: Example: Collect gems in a vast open world as a timer ticks!; **Why Is It Sticky?**: It is **familiar** in that it is fermentum ante faucibus. It is **unique** in that nunc semper, sem et ultricies tempus, lectus felis volutpat libero, sed efficitur ligula lectus vitae dolor. It is **memorable** in that neque urna, maximus sit amet facilisis et, ullamcorper a nibh.

## **STEAM PAGE STUDY**

Now let’s study these games’ Steam pages! Specifically, the short description and the cover art! Remember, Steam recommends 4 elements in the short description (listed below). Mark the recommended elements (or note that an element is missing) with the following:

(G) Genre  
(M) Mechanics / Actions  
(A) Appeal  
(S) Story

- **Game Name**: Game Name 1; **What’s The Short Description?**: “Forge your own path in Hollow Knight! An epic action adventure (G) through a vast ruined kingdom of insects and heroes (S). Explore twisting caverns, battle (M) tainted creatures and befriend bizarre bugs, all in a classic, hand-drawn 2D style (A).”; **Why Is The Cover Art Awesome (Or Not!)**: Nunc leo erat, tempus quis est sit amet, rhoncus tempus lectus. Nulla non nibh sed purus faucibus congue at a tortor. Sed dapibus fermentum leo, in urna dapibus non.
- **Game Name**: Game Name 2; **What’s The Short Description?**: Nunc leo erat, tempus quis est sit amet, rhoncus tempus lectus. Nulla non nibh sed purus faucibus congue at a tortor. Sed dapibus fermentum leo, in urna dapibus non.; **Why Is The Cover Art Awesome (Or Not!)**: Nunc leo erat, tempus quis est sit amet, rhoncus tempus lectus. Nulla non nibh sed purus faucibus congue at a tortor. Sed dapibus fermentum leo, in urna dapibus non.

Nulla non nibh sed purus faucibus congue at a tortor. Sed dapibus fermentum leo, in urna dapibus non.

# PART 2 | MOTIVATION

## **WHAT MAKES YOUR HEART-RATE INCREASE?**

Right now, think of a variety of topics. Which ones increase your heart-rate? What makes you excited? Don’t worry, these can be anything. Girls! Ghost stories! Hamburgers! Whatever. Don’t overthink this. Just write it down, fast. I’m not kidding. If your heart rate does not increase, you’re likely not passionate about it. 

If you’re passionate about it, you will likely want to **finish it**!

# PART 3A | THE TRINITY HOOK

## **THE TRINITY HOOK**

Remember, every great game has a strong hook in either the story, mechanics, or art-style (or all three!). Your goal should be to come up with all three, and aim for them all to actually be a hook! However, ultimately, it’s likely only one is actually a hook. But it’s best to de-risk, diversify, and try and accomplish all three!

- **Story**: Write what makes your story super engaging. Wish-fulfillment and creating curiosity with contrast is super helpful here!; **Mechanics**: Write the singular mechanic that makes your game super unique. Remember, you can use the “big but principle” (example: Metroid but Dark Souls); **Art Style**: Write or paste your art style here!

## 

# PART 3B | THE CORE GAME LOOP

## **THE LOOP**

Remember, according to Rising High Academy, the Core Game Loop is “essentially the very heartbeat of your game. It is a series or chain of actions that is repeated over and over as the primary flow your players experience.” If you’re having trouble listing out each step, your Core Game Loop may be closely related to your genre!

It is imperative you incorporate your trinity hook as best as you can into the loop. The Trinity Hook is the foundation to your game loop!

For example, the loop of Hollow Knight incorporates the “souls-like” genre into the metroidvania genre.

**List your three steps (or more) below:**

- **Step 1**: Ex: Enter new world; **Step 2**: Ex: Defeat enemies with current ability set; **Step 3**: Ex: Get a new ability!

## 

## **THE PRIMARY MECHANIC**

A Core Game Loop is *nothing* without a game mechanic pushing you through it! If you’re an indie, I highly suggest using a single mechanic that ensures the Core Game Loop is **Familiar, Unique, and Memorable**. For Hollow Knight, it’s simply hacking and slashing through the loop! For The First Tree, it’s exploring and collecting gems! For Resident Evil 4, it’s primary mechanic is shooting zombies in the face all while moving very slowly. What is your primary mechanic that delivers you through this loop? 

- Example: The player will be able to punch in all four directions (up, down, left, and right), only every time he punches, he speeds up time!

## **WHAT MAKES THIS MECHANIC, AND ULTIMATELY THE GAME LOOP, STICKY?**

To stick out in the giant ocean of indie games, and ultimately be profitable, you must have a sticky Core Game Loop. Fill out each section below to ensure your Primary Game Mechanic, and ultimately the Game Loop, is Familiar, Unique, and Memorable!

- **Familiar**: Write what makes your Core Game Loop familiar! Example: Our game is a classic beat-em-up style game in that you can punch enemies in any direction.; **Unique**: Write what makes your Core Game Loop unique! Example: It is unique in that instead of simply punching, the player will increase the time scale of the game as he punches, thus making the game more challenging the more he punches!; **Memorable**: Write what makes your Core Game Loop memorable! Example: The chaos that ensues when the game becomes increasingly faster is quite the challenge. We want players to remember that this game looks incredibly challenging, especially regarding reflexes.

# PART 4 | GAME OVERVIEW

## **GAME TITLE**

- Game Title Here

## **SINGLE SENTENCE DESCRIPTION**

This should be a single sentence (max 10 words!) that states the central conflict of the game, providing a synopsis of the plot and also the emotional “hook” to catch the players’ attention. 

- This is where your subtitle goes.

- **A bad subtitle is vague, wandering, and boring:**  ✗ “A game about a boy in a mysterious world.” ✗ “Discover the mystery in the forest and unlock the heartache of Kyle.” ✗ “Break through your weaknesses in this journey to the heart of everything.” ✗ “A puzzle adventure where nothing is at it seems.”

Get **subtitle inspiration** by checking out various Kickstarter projects, and reading  their one sentence descriptions! [https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/games](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/games)

## 

## 

## **SHORT DESCRIPTION**

Now let’s expand that super short description to be a bit more descriptive! So, what would you write in the short description on Steam (below the cover art)? In 2 sentences, explain the game using the following 4 tips from Valve:

* Identify your game’s **genre** and theme (eg. "A sci-fi turn-based strategy game")  
* Use specific verbs detailing your game’s primary **mechanics** and player actions  
* Communicate the essential **appeal** of your game  
* Save details regarding your game’s story and setting for your longer description

- This is where your short description goes.

- Here are some awesome examples of short descriptions that include genre (g), mechanics (m), and appeal (a):  “Forge your own path (m) in Hollow Knight! An epic action adventure (g) through a vast ruined kingdom of insects and heroes. Explore twisting caverns (g), battle (m) tainted creatures and befriend bizarre bugs, all in a classic, hand-drawn 2D style. (a)” “Help Madeline survive her inner demons on her journey to the top of Celeste Mountain (m), in this super-tight(a) platformer (g) from the creators of TowerFall. Brave hundreds of hand-crafted (a) challenges, uncover devious secrets, and piece together the mystery of the mountain (a).” “Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game (g) heavily focused on boss battles (m, a). Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional hand drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings. (a)”

## **LONG DESCRIPTION**

##  

What would you write in the long description box on your game’s Steam page (see examples)? Expand the elements of your short description, and just add details with a nice paragraph and a bulleted list of features. 

According to Steam, you should: 

“Use this space to describe your Game. Typically it is a good idea to start with a brief overview--if customers read nothing else, it should give them a pretty good idea of what your Game is about. Then you can go into more detail, add a list of key features, and whatever else you feel is relevant to describing your product.”

- This is where your long description goes.

- Check out [Lorem Ipsum Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/), [Lorem Ipsum Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), and [Lorem Ipsum Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268910/Cuphead/) for some awesome description examples!

## **PLOT**

Let’s talk about the plot! This is primarily about your story, although you should have an idea of how this story interacts with your gameplay.  First, let’s break down the various plot elements. Keep in mind, you may not have an antagonist, but you should probably have everything else to some degree. Keep it simple! We’ll get more specific and combine them later:

- Hook — What makes your plot emotionally resonate with the player.

- Setting — Where and when does your plot occur?

- Protagonist — Who is the main character (the player)?

- Antagonist — Who, or what, is the antagonist (the force fighting against the player)

- Struggle — What difficult challenge is presented to the protagonist?

- The Black Box — What mystery or end goal is presented to the player initially, pushing them to purchase the game to discover more?

- Gameplay Relation — How does the gameplay relate to this plot?

Now that you’ve broken down each element, it’s time to **combine them all** into a single paragraph explaining our plot:

- Combine your hook, setting, protagonist, antagonist, struggle, The Black Box, and gameplay relation here.

## **CHARACTERS**

THE PROTAGONIST

- Overview — Name, age, gender, personality, profession, etc.

- The Flaw — What makes your protagonist flawed? See below for tips!

- The Struggle — What is the protagonist's primary struggle in the plot? This will likely relate to the flaw.

- The Flaw  The flaw makes your protagonist’s personality sympathetic (meaning your players can’t help but sympathise/feel something toward the protagonist). *The more flawed, the better! Remember: Luke Skywalker was once a whiny brat, Beast was a selfish, angry prince, and Harry Potter was a scrawny orphan!*  It helps to draw from your own experience. Think of someone you know, or even yourself, and the personality flaws that drive you crazy! Here are a few examples: Weak willed, stubborn, cowardly, selfish, greedy, orphaned, lonely.

- The Struggle  What situation will occur that tests, and ultimately helps change your protagonist's personality flaw? Here are a few examples: Weak willed ➜ The protagonist is forced to fight off hijackers on a plane! Cowardly ➜ The protagonist is forced to enter a haunted mansion to find his father Greedy ➜ The protagonist’s family business goes up in flames after an attack, and he must save his poor neighbors trapped in his crumbling city.

THE ANTAGONIST

- Overview — Name, age, gender, personality, profession, etc.

- Threat To Protagonist — How does the antagonist threaten the protagonist? You can even mirror the protagonist's flaw. (For example, the protagonist is a coward, the antagonist is fearless).

- Believability — What makes our antagonist’s sinister motivations for evil believable and even relatable?

MINOR CHARACTER

- Overview — Name, age, gender, personality, profession, etc.

- Purpose — Why the heck does this minor character exist?

- Salt — What about this character salts (intensifies) the protagonist’s flaw and/or the antagonist’s threat?

## **GENRE** 

List out the primary and secondary genre using the large list below! Be sure to search on Wikipedia the definition of each, and paste in the gray fields!

- Primary Genre — Example: Platformer

- Wiki Definition — Example: Platformers are characterized by their heavy use of jumping and climbing to navigate the player's environment and reach their goal.

- Secondary Genre (optional) — Example: Beat-Em-Up

- Wiki Definition — Example: Featuring hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents.

- 4X game $ Action RPG Action-Adventure ✓ Adventure ✓ Art Game ✓ Battle Royale $ Beat 'em up ✓ Casual games ✓ Competitive Creative Esports $ Fighting First-Person Exploration ✓ Horror game ✓ JRPG MMO (Massive Multiplayer Online) $ MMORPG $ Metroidvania ✓ Monster Collection Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) $ Narrative-Adventure ✓ Open World $ — Platformer ✓ Puzzle ✓ Racing Real-time strategy (RTS) Real-time tactics (RTT) Rhythm  Roguelikes Simplistic Sandbox ✓ Sandbox Sandbox RPG Shooter✓ Simulation Sports Stealth Strategy Survival Horror $ Survival $ Tactical RPG $ Text adventures ✓ Tower defense ✓ Trivia game Turn-based strategy (TBS)

**$**  Expensive! Probably should avoid it!     
**✓** Typically a budget friendly genre for indies!

## **TARGET AUDIENCE** 

- Age Group — Example: 25-50

- Language — Example: English

- Gender — (Optional)

- Taste — Example: Love artsy, story games like Pinstripe and Neversong

- Other Traits

## **REWARDS**

PLOT REWARDS

What is the reward the player receives from a **plot perspective** at the end of the game? Could be a relationship resolved, a character saved, an enemy destroyed, a disaster averted, a mystery solved, etc. 

## 

How does this plot reward **tease the player** from the moment they see the trailer to the end of the game? Think of a carrot on a stick! Perhaps a mysterious event occurs at the beginning of the trailer/game. Perhaps his/her loved one is taken away from them, etc.

## 

GAMEPLAY REWARDS

What is the reward the player receives from a **gameplay perspective** throughout the game? This could be an upgraded character, a map, a boss pin, etc. 

## 

How does this gameplay reward **tease the player** from the moment they see the trailer to the end of the game? Again, think of a carrot on a stick! Perhaps the player starts with all of their abilities, and they are removed. Or, perhaps various areas are shown that you can’t quite get to!

## 

## **PUNISHMENTS**

Punishing the player is actually a great way to **make your rewards that much more rewarding**. There are a bunch of variables associated with inflicting pain on the player: health, time, inventory loss, abilities, story, distance, etc. For example, perhaps you could remove inventory items if the player does not play the game at a certain skill level. Or, maybe you just decrease health when the player gets hurt! It’s up to you!  List a maximum of three punishment techniques below, and the way in which that mechanism will be used to punish the player.

- **Example: If the player rushes past enemies and gets hurt,**: Example: **then** he will lose 10 coins.

- **Example: If the player shoots his gun for more than 10 seconds,**: Example: **then** he will lose 10 health due to the gun overheating and burning him.

- **Example: If the player spends all of his coins when buying inventory items**: Example: **then** he can overdraft, thus requiring him to pay interest payments.

## **OTHER GAMEPLAY MECHANICS** 

This is where we can specify any secondary mechanics that allow us to make our way through the Core Game Loop. However, as an indie, you should do your best to ensure these are somehow related to the Primary Game Mechanic! Try and be specific! But don’t worry, you can change a lot of this when you need to during development! You can copy and paste the rows below to create your own categories, or delete some, to your liking! 

Player Movement

- How does the player move, jump, transport, and spawn? Etc. etc.

Health Collection & Loss

- Does the player collect single health units, lose health when falling, or not have health at all? Etc. etc.

Player Conversation

- Does the player engage in conversation with NPCs? For what purpose? Do they have the option to have multiple conversations with dialogue trees?  Etc. etc.

Saving

- Can the player save whenever they like, or do they have to find a save zone?  Etc. etc.

Gaining & Losing Abilities

- How does the player gain a new ability? Are they abilities, or just new areas with new challenges? Can the player lose or extinguish  abilities?

## 

Currency

- How does currency work in the game? Is there an entire economy, is it simple, or does it even exist?

Inventory Management

- How many items can the player carry? Can the player carry any items at all? How do they use them? What is the User Interface (UI) like?

## **LEVEL DESIGN** 

GENERIC LEVEL DESIGN (COMPLETE BEFORE CREATION OF PROTOTYPE)

List a very generic description of how the world is laid out:

- For example: In Neversong, the player starts in a central hub, a happy village called Red Wind Village. He will then be able to traverse out in all directions, and even go to underground caverns. He can traverse back and forth, however, the world is much smaller in scale than a traditional metroidvania.

SPECIFIC LEVEL DESIGN (COMPLETE AFTER CREATION OF PROTOTYPE)

List a detailed description of each level, along with their linkage to other levels. Feel free to copy and paste each section below to add more levels to your document! 

Level 1

- What is the level called? What does it look like? What is its purpose? What is required for it’s entry? Can we revisit again? What is gained? What is it’s mood? How is this level related to the other levels? Etc.

Level 2

- What is the level called? What does it look like? What is its purpose? What is required for it’s entry? Can we revisit again? What is gained? What is it’s mood? How is this level related to the other levels? Etc.

Level 3

- What is the level called? What does it look like? What is its purpose? What is required for it’s entry? Can we revisit again? What is gained? What is it’s mood? How is this level related to the other levels? Etc.

## **MUSIC**

Briefly describe what you want your game’s music to sound like! 

- Genre — For example: Classical, Rock, Synth Wave, Hip-Hop, Retro, etc.

- Layering — Will the music use layering? Layering in games is when several tracks play at once, and fade in and out at different times depending on what’s occurring on screen!

- Mood — What kind of mood do you want your game’s music to convey? Happy, sad, exciting, grim, dark, upbeat, chill, atmospheric?

- Sample Track \#1 — What’s a song you really like in another game that you think might work in your game? Use this as direction for when you source your music!

- Sample Track \#2 — What’s a song you really like in another game that you think might work in your game? Use this as direction for when you source your music!

- Sample Track \#3 — What’s a song you really like in another game that you think might work in your game? Use this as direction for when you source your music!

## **CONTROL SCHEME** 

Briefly list your game’s control scheme! It’s ok, you can change this later! 

- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Lorem Ipsum
- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Tempus Quis
- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Nunc Leo
- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Lorem Ipsum
- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Tempus Quis
- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Nunc Leo
- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Lorem Ipsum
- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Tempus Quis
- **Button**: Button Name; **Action**: Nunc Leo

# PART 5 | 

# THE STOP & STARE FACTOR

## 

## **COLOR PALETTE**

Describe the general color palette and tone of your game. Is it dark, vibrant, low saturation, intense, etc? 

- Write your color palette description here.

Using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending), find some colors that really resonate with you, and that you can imagine being present in your game’s cover art! Then, right click on each square below and choose “Table Properties”. Go to “Cell Background Color”, and click on the Plus Icon. Paste in your color codes in each swatch below. This doesn’t mean you can’t use other colors in your game. But rather, think about the three colors that really represent your game! 

Example: Celeste Color Palette, as seen on it’s Steam Page Cover Art:

## **ATMOSPHERE**

Try your best to describe the atmosphere you’d like in your game. This will likely change, but it helps to start now!

- Describe the mood, atmosphere, lighting, weather, etc.

## **SAMPLE ART**

Find some screenshots on Steam of game art you really resonate with, and also that you feel you could accomplish:
