# Interactive Prompt-Engineering Framework for Game Design: Unified Research Synthesis

## Executive Summary

This synthesis consolidates research on orthogonal ability system design into a unified framework for developing an
interactive prompt-engineering tool for game design. By removing duplicative theory and resolving conflicts across
sources, this document provides a streamlined roadmap from Phase 1 research foundations to Phase 2 design
implementation, specifically optimized for decision-tree based prompt building.

## Phase 1: Theoretical Foundations & Research

### 1. Core Design Axioms

#### 1.1 Orthogonality Principle

**Consolidated Definition:** Each game element must possess at least one unique trait that cannot be replicated by
combining other elements, ensuring qualitative rather than quantitative differentiation.

- **Mathematical Foundation:** Abilities represented as vectors in n-dimensional space where orthogonality coefficient
  OC(A,B) = |A · B| / (||A|| × ||B||) approaches 0 for maximum uniqueness
- **Practical Target:** OC values between 0.1-0.3 for optimal balance between uniqueness and synergy
- **Implementation:** Use 5-dimensional effectiveness vectors: [Combat, Utility, Social, Economic, Exploration]

#### 1.2 Strategic Constraint Economy

**Unified Framework:** Every ability incurs multi-dimensional opportunity costs:

```
Cost = f(temporal, spatial, cognitive, resource)
```

Where:

- **Temporal:** Cooldowns (0.5-30s range), cast times, vulnerability windows
- **Spatial:** Range requirements, positioning constraints, area effects
- **Cognitive:** Attention load, prediction requirements, combo complexity
- **Resource:** Mana/energy (0-100 scale), charges, consumables

#### 1.3 Emergent Complexity Through Simple Rules

**Synthesis:** Design for critical complexity threshold where simple, deterministic rules yield unpredictable strategic
patterns.

- **Target Metrics:**
    - State Space Complexity (SSC) ≥ b^d where b=branching factor, d=depth
    - Emergence Index > 1.5 (observed behaviors / designed behaviors)
    - Discovery Rate > 2 new strategies per 1000 matches

### 2. Mathematical Architecture

#### 2.1 Unified Orthogonality Measurement

**Reconciled Formula:** After comparing three approaches, the optimal measurement system combines:

1. **Global Orthogonality Score (GOS):**
   ```
   GOS = 1 - (||O||_F / ||O_max||_F)
   ```
   Target: GOS ≥ 0.78 for system-wide independence

2. **Component Interaction Matrix:**
   ```
   C[i,j] = α·semantic_distance + β·mechanical_coupling + γ·temporal_alignment
   ```
   Weights tuned via reinforcement learning on simulated matches

#### 2.2 Strategic Diversity Metrics

**Consolidated KPIs:**

- Strategic Diversity Quotient (SDQ): 1/Σ(p_i²) where p_i = strategy usage proportion
- Skill Expression Index: win_rate(90th percentile) - win_rate(10th percentile)
- Meta Volatility Index: Measured via Fréchet distance between strategy distributions

### 3. Component Architecture Taxonomy

#### 3.1 Hierarchical Component System

**Unified Taxonomy (removing duplicates):**

**Tier 1 - Foundational Verbs (12 core actions):**

- Kinematic: translate, rotate, scale, warp
- State: apply, remove, transform, toggle
- Resource: generate, consume, steal, redistribute
- Information: reveal, obscure, falsify, predict

**Tier 2 - Contextual Modifiers (16 types):**

- Temporal: instant, channeled, delayed, periodic
- Spatial: targeted, area, cone, chain
- Conditional: threshold-gated, combo-dependent, state-reactive
- Stochastic: probability, critical chance, variance amplifier

**Tier 3 - Systemic Connectors (4 categories):**

- Prerequisite chains
- Mutual exclusions
- Amplification networks
- Echo patterns

**Grammar:** `Ability = Verb + Modifier* + Connector? + CostFunction`
